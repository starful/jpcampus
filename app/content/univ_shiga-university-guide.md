## 🏫 University Overview

Shiga University (Shiga Daigaku) is a prestigious national university in Japan, deeply rooted in the history and culture of the Shiga Prefecture. Known for its picturesque locations near Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan, the university is divided into two main campuses: the Hikone Campus and the Otsu Campus. Shiga University holds a unique position in the Japanese higher education landscape, particularly known for its Faculty of Economics—one of the oldest and most respected in the country—and its Faculty of Data Science, which was the first of its kind established in Japan. For international students, Shiga University offers a blend of traditional academic excellence, cutting-edge modern research, and a supportive, community-focused environment that is often less overwhelming than the massive urban campuses of Tokyo or Osaka.

### 🎓 Academic Excellence and Faculties

#### 1. Faculty of Economics (Hikone Campus)
The Faculty of Economics is the crown jewel of Shiga University. It traces its lineage back to the Hikone Higher Commercial School, founded in 1922. It is characterized by the spirit of the "Omi Merchants" (Omi Shonin), whose philosophy of "Sampo Yoshi" (Good for the seller, good for the buyer, and good for society) continues to influence the curriculum. The faculty offers departments in Economics, Finance, Management, and Accounting. It boasts one of the largest economic research libraries in Japan and maintains a high employment rate for graduates, many of whom enter top-tier financial institutions and multinational trading companies.

#### 2. Faculty of Data Science (Hikone Campus)
In 2017, Shiga University made headlines across Japan by establishing the nation's first Faculty of Data Science. This faculty was created to address the growing global demand for professionals who can analyze big data to solve complex social and business problems. Unlike traditional computer science programs, this faculty focuses heavily on statistical analysis and the practical application of data in real-world scenarios. Students work on projects with major corporate partners like Toyota, Nintendo, and various pharmaceutical companies. For international students interested in the intersection of mathematics, coding, and business strategy, this is arguably the most forward-thinking program in Japan.

#### 3. Faculty of Education (Otsu Campus)
Located closer to Kyoto in the city of Otsu, the Faculty of Education focuses on nurturing high-quality educators. It offers specialized training for elementary, junior high, and special needs education. The faculty is known for its strong ties to local schools, providing students with ample opportunities for practical teaching experience. While this faculty has fewer international students than Economics or Data Science, it remains a pillar of the university's mission to contribute to regional development.

### 🌍 Why International Students Choose Shiga University

Choosing Shiga University means opting for a "National University" (Kokuritsu) status, which carries significant weight in Japan. National universities are generally more affordable than private ones and are perceived as having higher academic rigor. 

**Strategic Location:** Hikone is a beautiful castle town, famous for Hikone Castle, one of the few original castles remaining in Japan. It offers a peaceful, safe, and historically rich environment for study. However, it is not isolated. By train, Hikone is only about 45-50 minutes from Kyoto and 60-70 minutes from Osaka, allowing students to enjoy the tranquility of Shiga while having easy access to Japan's major cultural and economic hubs.

**Industry Connections:** The Faculty of Data Science and Economics maintain robust networks with the Japanese corporate sector. The university frequently hosts career fairs and collaborative research projects, providing international students with a direct pipeline into the Japanese job market.

### 🏠 Campus Life and Housing

Life at Shiga University is defined by its proximity to Lake Biwa. Students often engage in water sports, cycling around the lake, or enjoying the local festivals. 

**International Student Housing:** The university provides dedicated international student dormitories (International House) at both the Hikone and Otsu campuses. These facilities are incredibly affordable compared to private apartments, with monthly rents often ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 JPY. The dorms provide a great environment for cross-cultural exchange, as Japanese 'tutors' (student volunteers) often live nearby to help international students adjust to life in Japan.

**Support Systems:** The International Center offers comprehensive support, including Japanese language classes ranging from beginner to advanced levels. They also assist with visa renewals, scholarship applications, and finding part-time jobs. The university also organizes cultural exchange events, such as tea ceremonies, calligraphy workshops, and field trips to historical sites in the Kansai region.

### 💰 Tuition, Scholarships, and Living Costs

As a national university, Shiga University’s tuition is standardized by the Ministry of Education (MEXT). 
- **Admission Fee:** 282,000 JPY (One-time payment)
- **Annual Tuition:** 535,800 JPY

For many international students, the university offers a **Tuition Waiver System**. Depending on academic performance and financial need, students can apply for a 50% or 100% tuition exemption. Additionally, students are eligible to apply for various scholarships, including the MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship, JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) honors scholarships, and private foundations such as the Heiwa Nakajima Foundation or the Rotary Yoneyama Memorial Foundation.

**Living Expenses:** Living in Shiga is significantly cheaper than in Tokyo or Osaka. A monthly budget of 80,000 to 110,000 JPY (including rent, food, and utilities) is usually sufficient for a comfortable student life.

### 📝 Admission Process for International Students

Admission to Shiga University is competitive and requires careful preparation. 

**1. Undergraduate Admission (EJU Path):** Most international applicants must take the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU). 
- **Required Subjects:** Usually include Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics, and Japan and the World (Liberal Arts).
- **Language Proficiency:** A high score in the EJU Japanese section or a JLPT N1/N2 certificate is typically required, as most lectures are conducted in Japanese.
- **Secondary Exam:** After passing the document screening based on EJU scores, students must usually travel to the campus for a faculty-specific exam and an interview.

**2. Graduate Admission:** For Master’s and Doctoral programs, applicants must find a potential supervisor whose research interests align with their own. The process involves submitting a research proposal, followed by an entrance examination and an interview.

### 🚀 Career Prospects and Employment

Shiga University has one of the highest employment rates among national universities in the Kansai region. The University’s Career Support Center provides specialized guidance for international students, including workshops on Japanese business etiquette, resume writing, and interview practice. 

Graduates from the Faculty of Economics often find roles in banking, insurance, and manufacturing. Data Science graduates are highly sought after in IT, logistics, and marketing analytics. For those looking to stay in Japan after graduation, the "Shiga brand" is well-respected by HR managers, particularly within the Kansai economic sphere.

### 🌟 Expert Consultant’s Final Advice

If you are a student who values academic prestige and wants to specialize in either traditional business/economics or the modern field of data science, Shiga University is a top-tier choice. It offers the best of both worlds: a high-quality, low-cost education in a peaceful environment, with the vibrant cities of Kyoto and Osaka just a short train ride away. 

I recommend that prospective students focus heavily on their Japanese language proficiency early on, as the integration into campus life and the success in the Faculty of Economics or Data Science depends significantly on your ability to navigate academic Japanese. For those targeting Data Science, ensure your mathematical foundations are strong. Shiga University is not just a place to study; it is a gateway to the Japanese professional world, rooted in a legacy of ethical business and innovative technology.
