## University Overview

Josai International University (JIU), or 城西国際大学, is a leading private institution in Japan, distinguished by its commitment to globalization and fostering international harmony. Established in 1992 by the Mizuho School Corporation, JIU's educational philosophy centers on nurturing individuals capable of contributing to the international community through practical knowledge and intercultural understanding. The university operates within the Josai University Educational Corporation, sharing resources and infrastructure with Josai University.

JIU is known for its multi-campus structure, providing students with distinct educational environments tailored to their field of study. The main campus is in **Togane, Chiba Prefecture**, offering a vast, natural environment ideal for undergraduate studies and residential life. The **Tokyo Kioicho Campus**, located in central Tokyo, specializes in graduate programs, media studies, and business, providing students with access to corporate and cultural centers. The **Awa Campus** (or Kujukuri Campus) supports specialized programs, notably tourism, leveraging Chiba's coastal resources.

The university emphasizes practical, career-oriented education, maintaining strong ties with industries across its core faculties—from film production in Media Studies to pharmaceutical research and international tourism management. This focus on real-world applicability ensures graduates are academically proficient and possess the skills demanded by the global workforce. JIU has a high ratio of international students, fostering a diverse learning environment rare among Japanese private universities. This diversity requires robust support systems and bilingual administration, making JIU an attractive destination for students seeking an internationalized Japanese university experience.

## Core Mission & Institutional Strengths

JIU's mission focuses on 'international mindedness' and 'practical skills.' The university uses its network of over 100 partner institutions worldwide, promoting study abroad programs. Its specialized curricula, such as the Global Communication Course, cater to non-native Japanese speakers who wish to engage with Japanese culture while maintaining English proficiency. The dynamic nature of its programs, combined with its strategic campus locations, defines JIU’s unique position in Japanese higher education.

## Faculties & Departments

Josai International University structures its academic offerings across seven major faculties, each containing specialized departments designed to meet global demands. The academic programs bridge theoretical knowledge with professional practice, utilizing the strengths of each campus location:

*   **Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences:** This faculty is the foundation of JIU’s international focus, housing departments like International Exchange Studies, Welfare (Social Work), and Psychological Studies. The curriculum focuses on cross-cultural understanding, language acquisition (Mandarin, Korean, and Spanish alongside English and Japanese), and preparing students for roles in diplomacy, NGO work, and multicultural management.
*   **Faculty of Management and Information Sciences:** Located primarily between the Togane and Tokyo Kioicho campuses, this faculty prepares future business leaders and IT specialists. Departments include Management, Accounting, and Information Science. The program emphasizes quantitative analysis, global marketing strategies, and the integration of technology into business operations.
*   **Faculty of Media Studies (Kioicho Campus Focus):** This is JIU's most prominent and industry-connected faculty, utilizing the location of the Tokyo Kioicho Campus. Departments cover Film Production, Digital Media, Journalism, and Broadcasting. Students benefit from professional-grade studios and access to Tokyo's media industry professionals.
*   **Faculty of Tourism:** Leveraging Chiba’s natural environment and proximity to airports, this faculty trains students in the travel and hospitality industries. Key areas include tourism management, cultural heritage preservation, and sustainable tourism development. Students gain practical experience along the Kujukuri coastline and specialized training in resort management and international travel logistics.
*   **Faculty of Contemporary Policy Studies:** Focusing on public administration, regional development, and modern governance, this faculty addresses societal issues through interdisciplinary approaches. Departments examine law, economics, and sociology to equip students to formulate effective public policies.
*   **Faculty of Nursing & Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences:** These faculties represent JIU’s commitment to health sciences. The Nursing program focuses on compassionate care and utilizes simulation facilities at the Togane campus. The Pharmaceutical Sciences program emphasizes advanced research in drug development, clinical pharmacy, and public health. These programs typically demand high proficiency in Japanese (N1/N2) for clinical placements and examinations.

## International Student Support

Josai International University provides comprehensive support systems designed to facilitate the transition and academic success of its international student body. This support spans immigration assistance, academic advising, financial aid, and housing.

### Housing and Residential Life

JIU encourages international students to reside in dormitories during their first year to promote integration. The housing options vary by campus:

*   **Togane Campus Dormitories (Mizuho Dormitory, International House):** These facilities offer cost-effective, furnished rooms (single or shared) with communal facilities. Living costs range from ¥30,000 to ¥50,000 per month, excluding meals.
*   **Kioicho Campus Housing:** Housing options near the Kioicho campus are university-affiliated apartments or subsidized private rentals, often starting at ¥60,000 per month.

### Academic and Welfare Support

The International Exchange Center (IEC) acts as the primary hub for foreign students, offering services such as visa renewal assistance, Japanese language proficiency classes, and cultural orientation sessions. Academic advisors are multilingual and trained to address challenges faced by international students.

### Scholarship Opportunities

JIU offers scholarships designed to mitigate the cost of attendance for international students:

1.  **JIU International Student Scholarship (Tuition Reduction):** Many students qualify for a tuition reduction, often ranging from 30% to 50% of the annual tuition.
2.  **Admission Fee Waiver/Reduction:** Exceptional candidates may receive a reduction or complete waiver of the entrance fee.
3.  **Mizuho Scholarship:** Based on academic performance post-enrollment, this internal scholarship offers financial support to maintain high grades.
4.  **External Scholarships:** JIU assists students in applying for external scholarships, most notably the JASSO Scholarship (Japan Student Services Organization).

### Admissions Criteria for International Students

All applicants must demonstrate proficiency for university-level study. Although many programs offer English-supported curricula, a minimum level of Japanese proficiency (typically JLPT N3 or N2 equivalent) is generally required for most undergraduate courses. The Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) is recommended, as strong EJU scores can enhance scholarship eligibility. Some faculties allow alternative submission methods (TOEFL/IELTS scores for English-track programs).

## Tuition & Fees

The financial structure at Josai International University reflects the pricing of a private university in the Tokyo metropolitan area, with initial costs covering entrance fees and yearly tuition, often offset by scholarship programs.

### Initial Year Financial Breakdown (Approximate):

| Item                      | Cost (JPY) | Notes                                                                     |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admission Fee**         | ¥280,000   | Paid once upon enrollment. Often reduced for international students.     |
| **Yearly Tuition**        | ¥1,250,000 | Average across non-science faculties. Science/Health fields may be higher. |
| **Facility Fee**          | ¥180,000   | Mandatory fee for campus maintenance and facilities usage.               |
| **Other Fees**            | ¥40,000    | Includes insurance, student association dues, and curriculum materials.  |
| **Total First Year (Before Scholarships)** | **¥1,750,000** | Approximately $11,500 USD (exchange rate dependent).                  |

### Financial Impact of Scholarships

For students who secure the JIU 30% tuition reduction scholarship, the effective annual tuition drops to approximately ¥875,000. The ability to work part-time (up to 28 hours per week) complements the financial aid, making JIU accessible compared to other institutions in central Tokyo, especially considering the lower cost of living around the Togane campus. Students should allocate an additional ¥800,000 to ¥1,200,000 annually for living expenses, depending on whether they reside on the Togane campus or the Kioicho area.
