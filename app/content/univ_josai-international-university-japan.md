## 🏫 University Overview

Josai International University (JIU), or 城西国際大学, stands as a premier private institution in Japan, highly distinguished by its foundational commitment to globalization and fostering international harmony. Established in 1992 by the Mizuho School Corporation, JIU's educational philosophy revolves around nurturing individuals capable of contributing to the international community through practical knowledge and intercultural understanding. The university operates under the broader umbrella of the Josai University Educational Corporation, sharing resources and infrastructure with Josai University.

JIU is particularly known for its multi-campus structure, offering students distinct educational environments tailored to their field of study. The flagship campus is located in **Togane, Chiba Prefecture**, providing a vast, natural, and expansive environment ideal for comprehensive undergraduate studies and residential life. In stark contrast, the **Tokyo Kioicho Campus** is situated in the heart of central Tokyo, specializing in graduate programs, media studies, and business, offering students immediate access to corporate and cultural hubs. Additionally, the **Awa Campus** (or Kujukuri Campus) supports specialized programs, notably tourism and certain hands-on training requirements, capitalizing on Chiba's coastal resources.

The university strongly emphasizes practical, career-oriented education, maintaining strong ties with industries across its core faculties—ranging from film production in Media Studies to pharmaceutical research and international tourism management. This institutional focus on real-world applicability ensures that graduates are not only academically proficient but also possess the competitive skills demanded by the modern global workforce. JIU boasts an extraordinarily high ratio of international students, fostering a truly diverse and multicultural learning environment that is rare among Japanese private universities. This diversity necessitates robust support systems and bilingual administration, positioning JIU as a highly attractive destination for students seeking a genuinely internationalized Japanese university experience.

### Core Mission & Institutional Strengths

JIU's mission is encapsulated by its dedication to 'international mindedness' and 'practical skills.' The university leverages its network of over 100 partner institutions worldwide, promoting mandatory or highly encouraged short-term and long-term study abroad programs. Its specialized curricula, such as the Global Communication Course, are designed specifically to cater to non-native Japanese speakers who wish to engage deeply with Japanese culture and academic rigor while maintaining proficiency in English as a medium of instruction for core subjects. The dynamic nature of its programs, combined with its strategic campus locations—offering both peaceful study environments and urban connectivity—defines JIU’s unique position in the Japanese higher education landscape.

## 🎓 Faculties & Departments

Josai International University structures its academic offerings across seven major faculties, each containing specialized departments designed to meet evolving global demands. The academic programs are meticulously crafted to bridge theoretical knowledge with professional practice, utilizing the specific strengths of each campus location:

### 1. Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences
This faculty is the bedrock of JIU’s international focus, housing departments like International Exchange Studies, Welfare (Social Work), and Psychological Studies. The curriculum strongly focuses on cross-cultural understanding, language acquisition (especially Mandarin, Korean, and Spanish alongside English and Japanese), and preparing students for roles in diplomacy, NGO work, and multicultural management. The International Exchange Studies Department is particularly popular among incoming students, as it offers tailored language support and deep dives into contemporary global issues.

### 2. Faculty of Management and Information Sciences
Located primarily between the Togane and Tokyo Kioicho campuses, this faculty prepares future business leaders and IT specialists. Departments include Management, Accounting, and Information Science. The program emphasizes quantitative analysis, global marketing strategies, and the integration of cutting-edge technology into business operations. For international students, courses often incorporate global case studies, making the transition to multinational corporations smoother.

### 3. Faculty of Media Studies (Kioicho Campus Focus)
This is arguably JIU's most prominent and industry-connected faculty, utilizing the prime location of the Tokyo Kioicho Campus. Departments cover Film Production, Digital Media, Journalism, and Broadcasting. Students benefit from professional-grade studios, direct access to Tokyo's media industry professionals, and hands-on experience in visual and audio production. The program is rigorous, designed for students aiming for careers in international cinema, television, or digital content creation.

### 4. Faculty of Tourism
Leveraging Chiba’s abundant natural environment and proximity to major international airports, this faculty trains students in the multifaceted aspects of the travel and hospitality industries. Key areas include tourism management, cultural heritage preservation, and sustainable tourism development. Students gain practical experience through fieldwork along the Kujukuri coastline and specialized training in resort management and international travel logistics, positioning them for roles in Japan’s booming tourism sector.

### 5. Faculty of Contemporary Policy Studies
Focusing on public administration, regional development, and modern governance, this faculty addresses complex societal issues through interdisciplinary approaches. Departments examine law, economics, and sociology to equip students to formulate effective public policies, particularly concerning urban planning, environmental regulation, and international security cooperation. The program is vital for those interested in government service or policy research.

### 6. Faculty of Nursing & 7. Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences
These faculties represent JIU’s strong commitment to health sciences. The Nursing program focuses on compassionate, evidence-based care and utilizes state-of-the-art simulation facilities at the Togane campus. The Pharmaceutical Sciences program is highly selective and emphasizes advanced research in drug development, clinical pharmacy, and public health. Due to the high regulatory standards required, these programs typically demand high proficiency in Japanese (N1/N2) for clinical placements and examinations, making them more challenging but highly rewarding for international candidates.

## 🌍 International Student Support

Josai International University provides comprehensive support systems specifically designed to facilitate the transition and academic success of its large international student body. This support spans immigration assistance, academic advising, financial aid, and housing.

### 🏠 Housing and Residential Life
JIU highly encourages, and in some cases requires, international students to reside in designated dormitories during their initial year to promote integration and security. The housing options vary significantly by campus:

*   **Togane Campus Dormitories (Mizuho Dormitory, International House):** These facilities offer cost-effective, furnished rooms (single or shared) with communal facilities. Living costs here are significantly lower than in Tokyo, ranging approximately ¥30,000 to ¥50,000 per month, excluding meals, offering a vibrant campus life experience.
*   **Kioicho Campus Housing:** Due to the high cost of central Tokyo real estate, housing options near the Kioicho campus are often university-affiliated apartments or subsidized private rentals, which are generally more expensive, often starting at ¥60,000 per month for a small unit, but offering proximity to cultural and professional opportunities.

### 🤝 Academic and Welfare Support
The International Exchange Center (IEC) acts as the primary hub for foreign students, offering services such as visa renewal assistance, Japanese language proficiency classes (beyond the regular curriculum), and cultural orientation sessions. Academic advisors within each faculty are multilingual and trained to address unique challenges faced by international students, including managing academic requirements and preparing for the Japanese job market (Shuukatsu).

### 🎓 Scholarship Opportunities
JIU offers generous scholarships designed to mitigate the cost of attendance for high-achieving international students:

1.  **JIU International Student Scholarship (Tuition Reduction):** Many incoming international students qualify for a significant reduction in tuition fees, often ranging from 30% to 50% of the annual tuition, based on entrance examination results and previous academic merit.
2.  **Admission Fee Waiver/Reduction:** Exceptional candidates may receive a reduction or complete waiver of the initial ¥280,000 entrance fee.
3.  **Mizuho Scholarship:** Based on academic performance post-enrollment, this internal scholarship offers continued financial support to maintain high grades.
4.  **External Scholarships:** JIU actively assists students in applying for external governmental and private scholarships, most notably the **JASSO Scholarship (Japan Student Services Organization)**, which provides a monthly stipend (currently around ¥48,000) for eligible privately funded international students.

### Admissions Criteria for International Students
While the specific requirements vary by faculty, all applicants must demonstrate adequate proficiency for university-level study. Although many programs offer English-supported curricula, a minimum level of Japanese proficiency (typically JLPT N3 or N2 equivalent) is generally required for most undergraduate courses, especially those requiring interaction with the local community (e.g., Nursing, Policy Studies). The Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) is recommended, particularly the Japanese component, as strong EJU scores can significantly enhance scholarship eligibility and streamline the application process, though some faculties allow alternative submission methods (e.g., direct application, TOEFL/IELTS scores for English-track programs).

## 💰 Tuition & Fees

The financial structure at Josai International University reflects the standard pricing of a reputable private university in the Tokyo metropolitan area, with initial costs covering entrance fees and yearly tuition, often offset by generous scholarship programs.

### Initial Year Financial Breakdown (Approximate):

| Item | Cost (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admission Fee** | ¥280,000 | Paid once upon enrollment. Often reduced for international students. |
| **Yearly Tuition** | ¥1,250,000 | Average across non-science faculties. Science/Health fields (Pharmacy, Nursing) may be higher (up to ¥1,700,000). |
| **Facility Fee** | ¥180,000 | Mandatory fee for campus maintenance and facilities usage. |
| **Other Fees** | ¥40,000 | Includes insurance, student association dues, and curriculum materials. |
| **Total First Year (Before Scholarships)** | **¥1,750,000** | Approximately $11,500 USD (exchange rate dependent). |

### Financial Impact of Scholarships

For students who successfully secure the JIU 30% tuition reduction scholarship, the effective annual tuition drops to approximately ¥875,000, significantly lowering the overall financial burden. Furthermore, the ability to work part-time (up to 28 hours per week, legally permitted for student visa holders) complements the financial aid, making JIU highly accessible compared to other major institutions in central Tokyo, especially when considering the relatively lower cost of living around the Togane campus. Students should allocate an additional ¥800,000 to ¥1,200,000 annually for living expenses (rent, food, utilities, transportation), depending on whether they reside on the economical Togane campus or the more costly Kioicho area.
