## University Overview

Doshisha University, situated in the historic city of Kyoto, is recognized as one of Japan's leading private universities. Established in 1875 by the forward-thinking educator Joseph Hardy Neesima (Niijima Jo), Doshisha was founded on Christian principles and a commitment to liberal arts education. Its aim was to develop conscientious individuals who would contribute positively to society. Neesima's educational philosophy emphasized not only academic excellence but also the cultivation of character, critical thinking, and a global perspective. This foundational ethos continues to influence Doshisha's academic environment, fostering a thriving intellectual community where students are encouraged to pursue knowledge with integrity and compassion.

The university is widely acclaimed for its rigorous academic standards, significant research contributions, and diverse student population. It is often included among the 'Kankandoritsu' (Kansai Gakuin, Kwansei Gakuin, Doshisha, Ritsumeikan), a group of top-tier private universities in the Kansai region. Doshisha's reputation extends internationally, attracting students and scholars from across the globe. Its alumni network is highly influential, with graduates making substantial contributions in diverse fields, including business, politics, academia, and the arts. The university's dedication to internationalization is further underscored by its participation in the Japanese government's Top Global University Project, which aims to enhance its global competitiveness and academic exchange.

The historic Imadegawa Campus, located next to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, provides a serene and inspiring setting, while the Kyotanabe Campus offers state-of-the-art facilities for science, engineering, and sports. The university's motto, 'Sola fide, Sola gratia, Sola scriptura' (By faith alone, By grace alone, By scripture alone), reflects its Christian heritage and underpins its commitment to holistic education and social responsibility.
