## 🏫 University Overview

Kagawa University is a prestigious national university located in Takamatsu, the capital city of Kagawa Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Established in 1949 through the merger of several local educational institutions—including the historic Takamatsu Higher Commercial School (founded in 1923)—the university has grown into a comprehensive academic hub that balances traditional values with innovative, future-oriented research. Known for its open and friendly atmosphere, Kagawa University is often referred to as a 'Community-rooted National University,' focusing heavily on regional development while maintaining a global outlook.

For international students, Kagawa University offers a unique proposition: the academic rigor of a Japanese national university combined with the high quality of life and lower costs of a regional city. It is strategically positioned near the Seto Inland Sea, an area famous for its beautiful landscapes and international art festivals (like the Setouchi Triennale), which serves as a living laboratory for students in design, social sciences, and environmental studies.

## 🎓 Academic Excellence and Faculties

Kagawa University consists of six undergraduate faculties and several graduate schools. Each faculty has its own distinct identity and strengths:

### 1. Faculty of Economics
With its roots in the Takamatsu Higher Commercial School, this is one of the oldest and most respected economics faculties in Japan. It offers deep insights into both local regional economies and global financial systems. Students benefit from an extensive network of alumni who occupy leadership positions in major Japanese corporations and government agencies.

### 2. Faculty of Engineering and Design
Unlike traditional engineering departments, this faculty was restructured to merge technical engineering with design thinking. It aims to produce 'Creative Engineers' who can solve complex social problems by integrating technology, art, and human-centric design. This makes it an ideal choice for students interested in robotics, architecture, and media technology with an aesthetic edge.

### 3. Faculty of Agriculture
This faculty is world-renowned for its research into 'Rare Sugars.' Under the guidance of Professor Ken Izumori, the university discovered the mass production method for D-psicose (Allulose), a zero-calorie sugar that is revolutionizing the global food industry. International students here work at the forefront of bio-resource science and food technology.

### 4. Faculty of Medicine
Located on the Miki Campus, the Faculty of Medicine is a leader in advanced medical research and regional healthcare. It boasts state-of-the-art facilities and a university hospital that serves as the primary medical center for the prefecture. Research focuses include nursing, pharmacology, and clinical medicine.

### 5. Faculty of Law
The Faculty of Law provides a robust education in legal theory and political science. It is particularly strong in preparing students for careers in public administration and corporate legal departments, with a curriculum that encourages critical thinking regarding the legal challenges of a globalized society.

### 6. Faculty of Education
Focusing on the development of highly skilled teachers, this faculty maintains strong links with local schools. It is an excellent choice for those interested in the Japanese pedagogical approach and regional educational development.

## 🔬 Research Spotlight: The Rare Sugar Hub

If you study at Kagawa University, you are entering the world's epicenter of Rare Sugar research. The university established the 'International Institute of Rare Sugar Research and Education,' which collaborates with global food giants. This focus on 'Izumoring'—the roadmap for production and application of rare sugars—provides students in agriculture and medicine with unparalleled research opportunities that have immediate commercial and health-related impacts worldwide.

## 🌏 International Student Support and Life

Kagawa University is deeply committed to internationalization. The International Office provides comprehensive support, including:

- **The Global Cafe:** A dedicated space on campus for international and Japanese students to interact, practice languages, and hold cultural exchange events.
- **Tutoring System:** Each international student is typically assigned a 'tutor' (a Japanese student) who helps them navigate daily life in Japan, from opening a bank account to understanding academic jargon.
- **Housing:** The university offers dedicated dormitories, such as the Kagawa University International House, which provides affordable, furnished accommodation within walking distance of the campuses.

## 🗾 Living in Takamatsu: The Setouchi Lifestyle

Takamatsu is the 'Gateway to Shikoku,' offering a perfect blend of urban convenience and natural beauty. For an international student, the benefits are numerous:

- **Cost of Living:** Rent and groceries are significantly cheaper than in Tokyo or Osaka, allowing students to focus more on their studies and less on part-time work.
- **Transportation:** Takamatsu is a 'bicycle city' with flat terrain and well-maintained paths, making commuting easy and free. It is also well-connected to the rest of Japan via the Takamatsu Airport and the Great Seto Bridge.
- **Culture and Nature:** From the historic Ritsurin Garden (one of Japan's most beautiful landscapes) to the nearby 'Art Islands' like Naoshima and Shodoshima, students have access to world-class cultural experiences. Kagawa is also the 'Udon Prefecture,' where a bowl of delicious noodles costs as little as 200 yen.

## 📝 Admission Information for International Students

Prospective students generally apply through the 'Special Selection for Privately Financed International Students.' Key requirements include:

- **EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission):** Most faculties require scores in Japanese as a Foreign Language, plus relevant subjects (Mathematics, Science, or Japan and the World).
- **Language Proficiency:** While some graduate programs offer courses in English, undergraduate programs primarily require a high level of Japanese (typically JLPT N2 or N1 equivalent).
- **Entrance Exams:** Shortlisted candidates are usually required to undergo an interview and, in some cases, an essay exam or a subject-specific test conducted by the university.

## 💰 Tuition and Scholarships

As a national university, Kagawa University’s tuition is standardized and highly affordable compared to private institutions or universities in the West:

- **Admission Fee:** ¥282,000 (one-time payment).
- **Yearly Tuition:** ¥535,800.

**Financial Support:** Many international students qualify for a 50% or 100% tuition waiver based on academic merit and financial need. Additionally, students can apply for the MEXT (Japanese Government) Scholarship, JASSO honors scholarships, and various private foundation grants specifically for those residing in Kagawa.

## 🚀 Career Prospects

Kagawa University has a high employment rate for its graduates. The 'Career Support Center' provides specialized guidance for international students looking to work in Japan, including resume workshops and mock interviews. Many graduates find employment in:

1.  **Manufacturing and Engineering:** Utilizing the university's strong ties with the industrial belt along the Seto Inland Sea.
2.  **Banking and Finance:** Especially within the regional banks of Shikoku and the Kansai region.
3.  **Food and Biotech:** Driven by the university's reputation in agricultural science.
4.  **Public Sector:** Roles in international relations and local government.
