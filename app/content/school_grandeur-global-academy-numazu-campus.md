## 🏫 School Overview & Philosophy

Grandeur Global Academy (GGA) Numazu Campus distinguishes itself as a premier destination for serious international students aiming for higher education in Japan, strategically located outside the saturated metropolitan areas. Situated in Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, GGA offers a unique balance: the tranquility and lower cost of living of a regional hub, coupled with rigorous academic standards typically associated with schools in Tokyo or Osaka. The academy's philosophy centers on the belief that true linguistic mastery and successful university matriculation require not just rote memorization, but holistic immersion and specialized preparation tailored to individual academic goals. Numazu’s advantageous location near Mount Fuji and the scenic Izu Peninsula provides students with an exceptionally supportive and safe environment, fostering deeper cultural understanding alongside intense language acquisition.

The academy’s mission is explicitly focused on empowering students to transition smoothly into Japanese higher education or the professional workforce. With a capacity designed for a manageable 240 students, GGA ensures a personalized learning environment where students receive ample individual attention from experienced faculty. This moderate size allows the school to create a tightly-knit, supportive community, addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by students preparing for demanding entrance examinations like the Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU). The dedication to specialized tracks, including dedicated pathways for science (理科) and art/design (美術/デザイン) majors, underscores GGA Numazu’s commitment to providing targeted academic pathways that maximize the likelihood of enrollment into highly competitive institutions across Japan. The institutional culture emphasizes discipline, clear goal setting, and continuous academic improvement, positioning GGA as a launching pad for future global leaders.

Studying in Shizuoka Prefecture offers inherent advantages beyond cost savings. The region is known for its high quality of life, access to nature, and proximity to major industrial centers, providing unique opportunities for cultural engagement and potential post-graduate employment that differ significantly from the high-pressure environment of massive urban centers. GGA leverages this regional strength by integrating local cultural workshops and encouraging community involvement, ensuring that students’ Japanese learning extends far beyond the classroom walls and into genuine daily communication scenarios. Furthermore, the commitment to providing guaranteed, high-quality dormitory accommodation, including the availability of highly sought-after single rooms, removes a significant initial hurdle for incoming international students, allowing them to focus entirely on their studies from day one.

## 📚 Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at Grandeur Global Academy Numazu is structured around two primary long-term visa tracks: the specialized 2-Year Higher Education Course (beginning in April) and the comprehensive 1-Year 6-Month Higher Education Course (beginning in October). Both courses share a foundational core focusing on developing the four essential language skills—reading, writing, speaking, and listening—but quickly diverge into highly specialized preparation modules designed to align with students' intended fields of study. The core curriculum progresses systematically from beginner levels (N5/N4 equivalent) through intermediate (N3/N2) to advanced fluency (N1 preparation), utilizing a communicative methodology that emphasizes practical application and output rather than passive study.

GGA’s teaching style is characterized by interactive, student-centered lessons. Instructors, who possess deep experience in teaching Japanese as a foreign language and preparing students for university entrance, employ a blend of traditional grammar instruction, task-based learning, and extensive mock testing. Crucially, the school is renowned for its specific academic tracks:

**1. Science Track (理科):** This specialized stream is designed for students aiming for Japanese universities in fields such as engineering, medicine, pharmacy, or pure science. Beyond advanced Japanese language instruction, the curriculum integrates preparatory classes for the EJU Science subjects, including Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (Course 2). These subjects are taught entirely in Japanese, familiarizing students with the necessary technical vocabulary and specific question formats used in Japanese entrance exams. The goal is to ensure students are not only linguistically ready but also possess the required foundational scientific knowledge in the Japanese context.

**2. Art and Design Track (美術/デザイン):** Recognizing the unique requirements of art universities (which often prioritize portfolio and specialized exams over pure EJU scores), this track offers focused instruction tailored to creative fields. Students receive targeted vocabulary related to art history, aesthetics, and design concepts. Critically, the program assists students with portfolio development and preparation for specialized practical exams. The academy provides guidance on selecting appropriate higher education institutions (e.g., specialized vocational colleges or four-year art universities) and facilitates connections with specialized external art preparatory schools, if necessary, ensuring a strong portfolio submission.

**3. Business Japanese & General Conversation Track:** For students intending to enter vocational schools (Senmon Gakko), find employment directly, or simply require highly refined conversational skills, GGA offers advanced modules focusing on keigo (honorific language), business etiquette, professional communication, and specialized terminology used in various industries. Short-term students also benefit from intensive conversation-focused modules, designed for rapid improvement in daily communicative fluency, integrating cultural insights into practical language use.

## 🌍 Student Body & Campus Life

With a capacity of 240 students, Grandeur Global Academy fosters a diverse yet cohesive student body. The enrollment typically draws students from various regions across Asia (including but not limited to China, Korea, Vietnam, Nepal, and South Asia), contributing to a genuinely international atmosphere. The medium size of the school is a deliberate asset, allowing for greater intercultural exchange in controlled, intimate settings, while ensuring that the primary language of communication remains Japanese, thereby maximizing immersion.

Campus life in Numazu is characterized by its safety, affordability, and accessibility. Unlike the sprawling urban centers, Numazu provides a genuine taste of regional Japanese life, which is ideal for students seeking deep immersion without the distractions and financial pressures of mega-cities. Students benefit from lower living costs, making the overall investment in their Japanese education more economical. GGA staff are proactive in organizing extracurricular activities designed to enrich the cultural experience and provide practical application of language skills.

These activities often include traditional cultural workshops (tea ceremony, calligraphy), seasonal festival participation in Numazu, and educational field trips to historical sites and regional economic hubs within Shizuoka Prefecture. A key component of GGA’s student support is robust welfare and counseling. Faculty members are not only language instructors but mentors who assist students with the challenges of adapting to a new country, offering advice on health services, financial management, and navigating local bureaucratic processes. The school places a strong emphasis on attendance and academic integrity, maintaining strict standards while providing the necessary support structure—a balance that is highly valued by prospective universities.

## 🎓 University & Career Pathways

GGA Numazu’s core strength lies in its specialized university entrance preparation. The program is explicitly geared toward success in the EJU and JLPT N1/N2 examinations, which are prerequisites for most four-year Japanese universities. The curriculum is meticulously calibrated to ensure students peak academically just prior to the key university application periods.

**EJU Preparation Excellence:** Students in the Higher Education tracks receive intensive training in all required EJU subjects. While core Japanese language instruction is universal, students follow customized tracks for the General Studies (Humanities/Social Sciences), Mathematics (Course 1 or 2), and the critical Science components (Physics, Chemistry, Biology). Classes are taught by specialists who are thoroughly familiar with EJU testing trends, utilizing past examination papers and highly accurate mock examinations to simulate the actual test environment. This rigorous preparation is vital for successful admission to highly ranked public and private universities across the Kanto and Tokai regions, including schools within Shizuoka Prefecture and wider national universities.

**Personalized Guidance and Counseling:** A dedicated Student Guidance Office provides comprehensive one-on-one counseling. This support covers: 1. University selection based on the student's academic profile and career aspirations (matching students with appropriate faculties, whether they are pursuing theoretical science or vocational design). 2. Assistance with application procedures, including translating and certifying required documents. 3. Intensive practice for university interview examinations (both written and oral), focusing on perfecting polite Japanese (keigo) suitable for high-stakes academic settings. 4. Detailed essay and research proposal writing workshops, particularly critical for graduate school or specialized undergraduate applications.

For students pursuing vocational pathways (often associated with the Business Japanese track), the academy provides resources for connecting with Senmon Gakko (vocational schools) specializing in IT, tourism, hospitality, and specific trades in the Shizuoka area. This holistic approach ensures that regardless of the student's ultimate goal—be it a competitive national university or immediate entry into the Japanese workforce—GGA provides a clearly defined and supported pathway.

## 🏡 Accommodation & Living Support

One of the most significant advantages offered by Grandeur Global Academy Numazu is its robust accommodation system. The 'Dormitory' feature is not just an option but a central component of the GGA support system, providing guaranteed, stable housing, which dramatically reduces the stress associated with moving to a new country.

**Guaranteed, High-Quality Dormitories:** GGA manages or partners with high-quality student residences located conveniently close to the campus, typically within walking distance or a short public transport ride. This proximity ensures students maintain excellent attendance records and minimizes commuting time, allowing more focus on studies. The initial cost structures typically incorporate a non-refundable dormitory management fee, covering the essential setup and orientation.

**The Single Room Advantage (1인실):** The availability of single rooms is a highly attractive feature, especially for serious students requiring a quiet, private environment for intensive study, EJU preparation, and focused portfolio work (for Art/Design students). While many language schools default to twin or quad rooms, GGA prioritizes the option of private living space, recognizing that personal space is crucial for long-term academic success. Dormitories are fully furnished and equipped with essential amenities, including reliable internet access, communal kitchens, laundry facilities, and common areas designed to facilitate controlled student interaction.

**Initial Settling-In Support:** Upon arrival at Numazu, students are guided through a mandatory initial orientation designed to quickly familiarize them with local life. This includes assistance with essential bureaucratic tasks, such as residency registration at the Numazu City Office, establishing bank accounts, enrolling in national health insurance, and guidance on local transportation systems. Furthermore, Numazu’s smaller, safer environment simplifies the process of finding approved part-time jobs (arubaito) once the student is settled and permission is granted, with the school often providing local employment guidance, though the primary focus remains on academic achievement.

## 💰 Tuition, Fees & Scholarships

Grandeur Global Academy Numazu offers competitive tuition rates, especially when factoring in the specialized course offerings and the cost benefits of living in Shizuoka compared to Tokyo or Kyoto. The listed tuition is comprehensive and generally covers the full period of study, excluding mandatory health insurance and certain miscellaneous costs.

**Scholarship Opportunities (장학금):**

GGA Numazu maintains a robust scholarship system to reward high-achieving and dedicated students. The school utilizes three primary scholarship avenues:

1.  **Academic Excellence Scholarships:** Awarded to students who demonstrate exceptional results in the EJU, JLPT, or internal school exams. These often cover a reduction in subsequent tuition payments or provide a stipend.
2.  **Attendance and Conduct Scholarships (In-School):** These are performance-based scholarships rewarding students who maintain near-perfect attendance (100% or 95%+) and exhibit exemplary behavior and active participation in class. Given the strict attendance requirements for visa renewal and university recommendation letters, these are highly encouraged.
3.  **External Scholarships:** The academy actively assists eligible students in applying for prestigious external scholarships, such as the Japanese Government (MEXT) Honors Scholarship for Privately Financed International Students (through the JASSO system). The school provides guidance on the stringent application processes and necessary recommendation documentation required to secure these major financial awards, ensuring their top students have access to all available financial support.
