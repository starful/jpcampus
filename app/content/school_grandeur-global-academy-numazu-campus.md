## School Overview & Philosophy

Grandeur Global Academy (GGA) Numazu Campus is a leading institution for international students seeking higher education in Japan. Conveniently located outside major metropolitan areas in Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, GGA offers the tranquility and affordability of a regional hub with the rigorous academics of schools in Tokyo or Osaka. The academy believes that mastering the Japanese language and gaining university admission require holistic immersion and specialized preparation tailored to individual academic goals. Numazu's location near Mount Fuji and the Izu Peninsula provides students with a supportive and safe environment, fostering cultural understanding and language acquisition.

The academy's mission is to prepare students for Japanese higher education or the professional workforce. With a capacity of 240 students, GGA ensures personalized learning and individual attention from experienced faculty. This size allows the school to create a close-knit community that addresses the specific needs of students preparing for entrance examinations like the Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU). The specialized tracks, including pathways for science and art/design majors, demonstrate GGA Numazu's commitment to providing targeted academic routes that maximize enrollment into competitive institutions across Japan. The institutional culture emphasizes discipline, goal setting, and continuous academic improvement, positioning GGA as a launching pad for future global leaders.

Studying in Shizuoka Prefecture offers advantages beyond cost savings. The region is known for its high quality of life, access to nature, and proximity to industrial centers, providing opportunities for cultural engagement and post-graduate employment. GGA integrates local cultural workshops and encourages community involvement, ensuring students' Japanese learning extends beyond the classroom. Guaranteed, high-quality dormitory accommodation, including single rooms, removes initial hurdles for international students, allowing them to focus on their studies from day one.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at Grandeur Global Academy Numazu is structured around two long-term visa tracks: the 2-Year Higher Education Course (starting in April) and the 1-Year 6-Month Higher Education Course (starting in October). Both courses focus on developing reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, but quickly specialize to align with students' fields of study. The core curriculum progresses from beginner (N5/N4 equivalent) through intermediate (N3/N2) to advanced fluency (N1 preparation), using a communicative methodology that emphasizes practical application.

GGA’s teaching style is interactive and student-centered. Instructors, experienced in teaching Japanese as a foreign language and preparing students for university entrance, use grammar instruction, task-based learning, and mock testing. The school is known for its academic tracks:

*   **Science Track:** Designed for students aiming for Japanese universities in engineering, medicine, pharmacy, or science. It includes advanced Japanese language instruction and preparatory classes for EJU Science subjects (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics - Course 2), taught entirely in Japanese to familiarize students with technical vocabulary and exam formats.
*   **Art and Design Track:** Recognizing the requirements of art universities, this track offers instruction tailored to creative fields. Students receive vocabulary related to art history, aesthetics, and design concepts, and assistance with portfolio development and specialized practical exams. The academy provides guidance on selecting higher education institutions and facilitates connections with external art preparatory schools.
*   **Business Japanese & General Conversation Track:** For students entering vocational schools (Senmon Gakko), finding employment, or requiring refined conversational skills, GGA offers modules focusing on keigo (honorific language), business etiquette, professional communication, and terminology. Short-term students benefit from intensive conversation-focused modules for rapid improvement in communicative fluency, integrating cultural insights.

## Student Body & Campus Life

With a capacity of 240 students, Grandeur Global Academy fosters a diverse student body, typically drawing from Asia (including China, Korea, Vietnam, Nepal, and South Asia), creating an international atmosphere. The school's size allows for intercultural exchange while ensuring that the primary language of communication remains Japanese, maximizing immersion.

Campus life in Numazu is characterized by its safety, affordability, and accessibility. Numazu offers a taste of regional Japanese life, ideal for students seeking immersion without the distractions of mega-cities. Students benefit from lower living costs. GGA staff organize extracurricular activities to enrich the cultural experience and provide practical application of language skills.

These activities include cultural workshops (tea ceremony, calligraphy), festival participation, and field trips to historical sites and economic hubs within Shizuoka Prefecture. GGA’s student support includes welfare and counseling. Faculty members are mentors who assist students with adapting to a new country, offering advice on health services, financial management, and local processes. The school emphasizes attendance and academic integrity, providing the necessary support structure.

## University & Career Pathways

GGA Numazu’s strength lies in its specialized university entrance preparation. The program prepares students for the EJU and JLPT N1/N2 examinations, prerequisites for most four-year Japanese universities. The curriculum ensures students peak academically prior to university application periods.

*   **EJU Preparation Excellence:** Students receive intensive training in all required EJU subjects, with customized tracks for General Studies (Humanities/Social Sciences), Mathematics (Course 1 or 2), and Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology). Classes are taught by specialists familiar with EJU testing trends, using past papers and mock examinations. This preparation is vital for admission to public and private universities across the Kanto and Tokai regions, including schools within Shizuoka Prefecture and national universities.
*   **Personalized Guidance and Counseling:** A dedicated Student Guidance Office provides one-on-one counseling, covering: 1. University selection based on the student's profile and career aspirations. 2. Assistance with application procedures, including translating documents. 3. Practice for university interview examinations, focusing on polite Japanese (keigo). 4. Essay and research proposal writing workshops.

For students pursuing vocational pathways, the academy provides resources for connecting with Senmon Gakko (vocational schools) specializing in IT, tourism, hospitality, and specific trades in the Shizuoka area. GGA provides a supported pathway whether the student's goal is a competitive national university or entry into the Japanese workforce.

## Accommodation & Living Support

Grandeur Global Academy Numazu's accommodation system is a central component of its support, providing guaranteed, stable housing, which reduces the stress of moving to a new country.

*   **Guaranteed, High-Quality Dormitories:** GGA manages or partners with student residences located close to the campus. This proximity ensures attendance and minimizes commuting time. Initial costs incorporate a dormitory management fee.
*   **The Single Room Advantage:** The availability of single rooms is attractive, especially for students requiring a quiet environment for study and portfolio work. GGA prioritizes private living space, recognizing that personal space is crucial for academic success. Dormitories are furnished and equipped with amenities, including internet access, communal kitchens, laundry facilities, and common areas.
*   **Initial Settling-In Support:** Upon arrival, students are guided through an orientation to familiarize them with local life. This includes assistance with residency registration, bank accounts, national health insurance, and local transportation systems. Numazu’s smaller environment simplifies finding part-time jobs (arubaito) once permission is granted, with the school providing employment guidance, though the focus remains on academic achievement.

## Tuition, Fees & Scholarships

Grandeur Global Academy Numazu offers competitive tuition rates, factoring in the specialized course offerings and the cost benefits of living in Shizuoka compared to Tokyo or Kyoto. The tuition covers the full period of study, excluding health insurance and miscellaneous costs.
