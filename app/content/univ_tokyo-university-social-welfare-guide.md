## 🏫 University Overview

Established in 2000, Tokyo University of Social Welfare (TUSW) has rapidly become a prominent educational institution dedicated to developing highly skilled professionals in fields crucial to contemporary Japanese society, including social welfare, education, psychology, and management. TUSW distinguishes itself among private universities through its commitment to addressing the urgent needs of Japan's aging population and the increasing demand for specialized mental health and childcare support. It operates with a unique multi-campus system, offering access and specialized focus across various regions: the Ikebukuro and Oji Campuses in Tokyo, the Nagoya Campus, and the Isesaki Campus in Gunma Prefecture.

The university's mission is centered on the principle of 'Welfare for All' (全ての人のための福祉), with an emphasis on practical application, fieldwork, and direct community engagement. This approach is particularly advantageous for international students aspiring to build careers in Japan, as the curriculum is structured to directly lead to nationally recognized qualifications and licenses, such as Certified Social Worker (*Shakai Fukushi-shi*), Certified Care Worker (*Kaigo Fukushi-shi*), and various teaching licenses (*Kyoin Menkyo*).

TUSW is notable for its relatively high proportion of international students. While this fosters a diverse learning environment, prospective students should be aware that the core curriculum—especially in fields like social welfare and education, which require a deep understanding of Japanese law, administrative systems, and cultural nuances—is taught exclusively in advanced academic Japanese. The university provides a comprehensive support system for language and cultural integration; however, proficiency at the JLPT N2 level or higher is an essential prerequisite for meaningful academic success.

Its Ikebukuro campus, situated in the heart of metropolitan Tokyo, offers excellent access to internships, government offices, and cultural resources, enhancing the overall learning experience. TUSW focuses on vocational excellence rather than broad research, making it an ideal choice for career-oriented international students seeking stable employment in fields with high demand in Japan.

## 🎓 Faculties & Departments

TUSW offers a focused selection of undergraduate programs designed to achieve specific vocational outcomes. The structure is designed to guide students toward professional certification immediately upon graduation.

### Faculty of Social Welfare (社会福祉学部)

This is the flagship faculty and central to TUSW’s identity. It prepares students for critical roles in public and private welfare organizations, hospitals, and specialized residential facilities.

*   **Department of Social Welfare:** The primary objective is to obtain the Certified Social Worker (CSW) license, a highly respected national qualification. Studies cover social security law, clinical theory, public assistance programs, and specialized counseling techniques. International students interested in this field must possess exceptional reading comprehension skills to navigate complex legal texts and government documents.
*   **Department of Care and Welfare (Care Worker Focus):** This department focuses specifically on the practical skills required for providing physical and emotional care. Graduates typically pursue the Certified Care Worker qualification, a crucial certification given Japan's demographic structure.

### Faculty of Psychology (心理学部)

Addressing the increasing need for mental health professionals, this faculty offers comprehensive training in foundational and clinical psychology.

*   **Department of Clinical Psychology:** This department provides a pathway toward advanced studies (Graduate School) required for the Certified Public Psychologist and Clinical Psychologist licenses. The curriculum includes behavioral science, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and extensive practical training in assessment and intervention methods. This field often involves internships in schools or hospitals, demanding high levels of ethical and linguistic competency.

### Faculty of Child Development and Education (子ども学部)

This faculty is dedicated to training teachers, nursery school staff, and child welfare specialists.

*   **Department of Child Development and Education:** Offers certifications for kindergarten, elementary school teaching, and certified nursery staff (*Hoikushi*). The program emphasizes developmental theory, practical classroom management, and specialized education methods for children with diverse needs. Due to the high cultural context of teaching in Japan, acceptance into this department usually requires proven cultural understanding and flawless Japanese.

### Faculty of Education (教育学部)

This faculty focuses on training professionals for teaching positions across different educational levels, often supplementing the offerings of the Child Development faculty.

*   **Department of Education:** While overlap exists with the Child Development faculty, this department often focuses on secondary education or specialized areas such as Special Needs Education (*Tokubetsu Shien Kyoiku*). This is a highly regulated field in Japan, requiring adherence to national curriculum standards.

### Faculty of Business Management (経営学部)

This faculty applies administrative and organizational theory to the non-profit sector, public administration, and human resource management.

*   **Department of Business Management:** Prepares students for managerial roles within social welfare organizations, NPOs, healthcare administration, and standard corporate settings, offering a blend of economics, law, and organizational behavior.

## 🌍 International Student Support

TUSW prioritizes the integration of its international student population, primarily due to the high demand for multilingual professionals in welfare and related industries.

### Admission Requirements

The standard route for international enrollment requires evidence of 12 years of schooling outside Japan and strong Japanese language proficiency. While specific requirements can vary by faculty, all applicants are expected to demonstrate language skills equivalent to **JLPT N2 (minimum)**, though N1 is strongly recommended, especially for welfare or education fields where precise legal and medical terminology is used daily. Many faculties require the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**, specifically the Japanese language component, and potentially tests in subjects like General Knowledge or Mathematics, depending on the chosen major.

### Scholarship Opportunities

International students at TUSW are eligible to apply for several key financial aid programs:

*   **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarships:** While TUSW primarily supports privately funded students, successful applicants may be able to transition to MEXT scholarships post-enrollment or apply via embassy recommendations.
*   **JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) Scholarships:** TUSW students are prioritized for the JASSO scholarship, offering a monthly stipend to support living expenses for top-performing international students demonstrating financial need.
*   **TUSW Internal Scholarships:** The university offers various merit-based or financial need-based tuition reduction schemes or grants specifically targeting enrolled international students to ease the financial burden of studying in Tokyo.
*   **Local Government/Private Foundation Scholarships:** The International Student Support Office actively assists students in applying for external scholarships offered by local Tokyo/Nagoya foundations and other private organizations dedicated to supporting foreign students.

### Accommodation and Life Support

While TUSW does not guarantee dormitory placement for all international students, it offers significant support in securing suitable off-campus housing. The university operates or partners with several student houses and assists in navigating local real estate contracts (a frequently challenging process for newcomers).

The International Student Center provides essential non-academic support, including immigration guidance (visa renewals), cultural adaptation counseling, and employment placement assistance. Crucially, given the vocational focus, the university maintains strong ties with welfare and educational organizations, often leading directly to job offers for graduating students who successfully attain their professional certifications.

## 💰 Tuition & Fees

Studying at a private university in Tokyo entails considerable costs, and TUSW's fee structure reflects the specialized, practical nature of its vocational training. The figures provided below represent standard estimates for undergraduate entry, though specialized faculties or programs (like those heavily involving clinical fieldwork) might incur slight variances in lab/training fees.

### Initial Expenses (First Year)

*   **Admission Fee (Enrollment Fee):** ¥230,000 (One-time payment upon enrollment)
*   **Yearly Tuition:** ¥1,050,000 (This amount is typically divided into two installments, paid in Spring and Autumn.)
*   **Other Fees (Facilities, Training, Student Union):** Approximately ¥50,000 – ¥80,000 annually.

**Total Estimated First-Year Cost (Excluding living expenses):** Approximately ¥1,330,000 to ¥1,360,000.

### Subsequent Years

From the second year onward, the Admission Fee is waived, reducing the annual required payment to approximately **¥1,100,000 – ¥1,130,000** (Tuition plus miscellaneous fees). Students are strongly encouraged to utilize scholarship opportunities and part-time work (within visa regulations) to manage these expenses. The high return on investment comes from the strong job placement record in certified fields, where initial salaries are often competitive and stable within the public and non-profit sectors.
