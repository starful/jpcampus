## 🏫 School Overview & Philosophy

Kobe Gaigo Kyoiku Gakuin, nestled in the heart of Kobe's Nagata-ku, offers a focused and dedicated environment for international students aspiring to pursue higher education in Japan. Unlike some language schools that balance general language learning with cultural experiences, Kobe Gaigo Kyoiku Gakuin prioritizes rigorous academic preparation, specifically targeting success in the Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU) and subsequent university entrance exams. The school's location in Nagata-ku provides a more local and less tourist-centric experience of Kobe, allowing students to immerse themselves in daily Japanese life while still being within easy reach of Kobe's central areas and other major cities in the Kansai region.

The school's philosophy centers around providing students with the knowledge, skills, and support necessary to excel in their chosen academic fields. This includes not only comprehensive language instruction but also specialized subject-matter tutoring, particularly in science-related disciplines. The teaching methodology emphasizes active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving, preparing students for the challenges of university-level coursework. The large capacity of the school, accommodating over 500 students, allows for a diverse student body and a rich learning environment.

Kobe, as a city, has a long history of international trade and cultural exchange. This cosmopolitan atmosphere is reflected in the school's approach to education, fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding. The school aims to equip its graduates not only with academic qualifications but also with the intercultural communication skills necessary to thrive in a globalized world. While the exact history of the school's founding is not specified, its commitment to university preparation suggests a long-standing tradition of supporting international students in their academic endeavors in Japan. The focus on EJU preparation, dormitory availability, and STEM stream support highlight the school's dedication to providing a comprehensive and practical pathway to higher education in Japan.
