## School Overview & Philosophy

Tokyo International Business College, Japanese Language Department, is more than just a language education institution. It's a specialized educational platform designed to provide a systematic stepping stone for students aiming for successful university advancement and entry into professional careers in Japan. Located in the vibrant heart of Tokyo, specifically in Taito-ku Yanagibashi, where business and culture coexist, students enjoy optimal geographical access to both cutting-edge business environments and traditional Japanese culture. This serves as a crucial element in realizing the school's philosophy of 'language education linked to real life.' The school's total capacity is relatively small at 200 students, which allows for close supervision and personalized education for each individual. This environment fosters an intimate and highly focused learning atmosphere that is difficult to achieve in larger schools, and it forms the basis of a strong support system that helps international students quickly adapt to an unfamiliar environment and achieve their academic goals.

The school's ultimate educational goal is to cultivate business professionals with an international perspective. Going beyond simply aiming for JLPT N1 certification, the focus is on cultivating practical communication skills, business etiquette, and in-depth academic Japanese language proficiency required for successful studies after advancing to Japanese universities or vocational schools, or when employed by Japanese companies. Especially given the nature of the parent institution as a Senmon Gakko (specialized training college), even within the Japanese language education curriculum, students are provided with opportunities to learn vocabulary, document creation, presentation skills, and other elements necessary for practical business. This provides a differentiated educational environment that is highly advantageous for students with clear career goals in business or specialized fields after studying abroad. The school concurrently provides holistic education so that international students can develop both the ethical awareness and international sensibility needed as members of Japanese society. This educational philosophy contributes to enhancing students' language abilities as well as their social and professional competence, and ensures they acquire skills immediately applicable in Japanese society after graduation. From the time of admission to the progression towards higher education and employment, dedicated teachers carefully manage every step of the process, aiming to maximize each student's potential.

The school's curriculum is specifically designed around two core pillars: enhancing 'higher education advancement' and 'conversational' abilities. In the higher education preparation course, specialized lectures are provided to thoroughly prepare for the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students). Students undergo intensive training in academic reading and writing skills tailored to the characteristics of Japanese university entrance examinations. Simultaneously, diverse practical, hands-on classes are organized to cultivate natural and fluent conversation skills essential for school life, daily life, and future work life. The intention here is not to simply measure Japanese language ability by test scores, but to help students freely use the language as a living tool. Consequently, graduates of the school not only achieve high test scores, but also acquire practical language operation skills that allow them to communicate smoothly with Japanese speakers and participate in academic discussions. Through these specialized educational programs, the school offers the best possible environment to ensure students can successfully begin and complete their studies in Tokyo.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The educational program at Tokyo International Business College, Japanese Language Department, operates as a single 'Japanese Language Department' course, but the detailed curriculum is flexibly adjusted according to students' admission period (April or October) and their individual Japanese language abilities and ultimate goals. The educational objective is to provide a systematic roadmap from the initial adaptation stage to the acquisition of advanced academic and business Japanese. The teaching style of this school emphasizes practical language usage skills rather than simple rote memorization. In particular, as indicated by the 'Emphasis on Conversation' tag, classroom activities mainly involve student-participatory teaching methods such as presentations, discussions, role-playing, and real-life simulations. This is to train students to immediately utilize the grammar and vocabulary they have learned in real-world situations.

The curriculum is clearly divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, and specialized classes required for higher education preparation are added at each level. From the intermediate level onwards, supplementary classes are offered to prepare for EJU required subjects (in addition to Japanese, subjects such as General Subjects and Mathematics), supporting international students so they can complete all necessary entrance exam preparation within the school without relying on private tutoring. Additionally, since the school is an affiliated institution of a business vocational school, advanced level students who wish to work in Japan or advance to business-related specialized fields receive intensive education on business manners, polite language usage, and business document writing in the regular curriculum, setting them apart from other general Japanese language schools. Students assess their skills through regular mock exams and adjust their academic plans through one-on-one consultations with their homeroom teachers, establishing the optimal path needed to achieve their goals. Teachers are well-versed in the Japanese university entrance exam system based on their extensive experience and provide students with the most efficient learning strategies.

## Student Body & Campus Life

Tokyo International Business College, Japanese Language Department, is creating a multinational learning environment where students of various nationalities are devoted to their studies, fitting for the international atmosphere of Tokyo. Thanks to the characteristic of being a small school with a total capacity of 200 students, it is easy for students to form close bonds that transcend nationalities. As with typical Japanese language schools in Tokyo, students from Asian countries (China, Vietnam, Nepal, Korea, Taiwan, etc.) make up the majority, but the school actively promotes multicultural exchange programs so that students can develop an international sensibility by interacting with friends from diverse cultural backgrounds. This goes beyond simple language acquisition, playing an important role in cultivating the inclusiveness and collaborative skills suitable for future global business environments.

Campus life follows the atmosphere of a business college, with a strong academic and goal-oriented atmosphere. Students can concentrate on their studies in an autonomous yet disciplined environment, which is especially positive for students who want to develop self-management skills in preparation for advancing to Japanese universities or vocational schools. The school conducts a very detailed initial orientation to help international students adapt to life in Japan, providing essential information such as residency status, health insurance, and living rules. In addition, students are provided with opportunities to experience 'living Japanese' and Japanese society outside of textbooks through various extracurricular activities such as traditional Japanese cultural experience events, local volunteer activities, and business-related field trips. These activities help students improve their language skills, deepen their understanding of Japanese culture, and increase their satisfaction with school life. The student counseling system also provides individual counseling on personal issues such as mental health and academic concerns, and career decisions to minimize the difficulties of studying abroad.

## University & Career Pathways

One of the most powerful features of this school is its systematic support system specializing in 'higher education advancement.' Tokyo International Business College, Japanese Language Department, provides customized higher education guidance tailored to students' desired career paths and offers an optimized environment for students aiming to advance to prestigious Japanese universities and competitive vocational schools. The school's higher education preparation curriculum prioritizes acquiring high scores on the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students), and dedicated instructors intensively guide students in in-depth study of EJU subjects and problem-solving techniques. In addition to general Japanese language classes, various EJU elective subject courses (e.g., General Subjects, Mathematics courses, etc.) are offered for students to choose from, allowing them to adequately prepare for exams without relying on external cram schools.

The higher education guidance process proceeds in the following stages: Stage 1 – Goal setting and EJU preparation, Stage 2 – Selecting supporting universities and vocational schools and analyzing entrance examination guidelines, Stage 3 – Preparing documents and guiding the writing of short essays/research proposals, Stage 4 – Training for university-specific customized interviews and oral exams. In particular, the guidance on writing short essays and research proposals is a very important factor in university entrance exams, and specialized teachers provide individual corrections and feedback to help students submit high-quality documents that meet Japanese academic standards. Furthermore, given that the school is a vocational school, if students choose to advance internally to other specialized departments (e.g., International Business, IT, Tourism, etc.) after completing the language program, there is a high possibility of receiving preferential admission benefits. This becomes an attractive option for students seeking continuity and expertise in their studies. The regularly held higher education information sessions and alumni mentoring programs greatly help students obtain realistic information and develop successful higher education strategies.

## Accommodation & Living Support

A major advantage of Tokyo International Business College, Japanese Language Department, is that it offers 'dormitory' options to help international students settle in smoothly during the initial stages. By solving the initial housing problem, one of the biggest burdens for students starting their studies in Tokyo, the school creates an environment where students can concentrate solely on their studies. School dormitories are usually located in convenient locations for commuting and provide a safe and clean environment. Dormitory options are generally provided in the form of single or double rooms, allowing students to choose according to their budget and preferences. The dormitories are fully equipped with basic living amenities (furniture, kitchen facilities, laundry facilities, internet connection, etc.), allowing international students to start their life in Japan with minimal luggage.

Dormitory life goes beyond simply providing accommodation, becoming a place for community life that promotes interaction and mutual assistance among students. The school strictly manages dormitory living rules to maintain safety and order, and immediate support is provided in the event of problems. Upon initial occupancy, an orientation is provided detailing all the information necessary for living, such as how to use the dormitory, information on surrounding amenities, and transportation information. In addition to dormitories, the school also provides information on share houses or rental apartments through external partner companies according to students' wishes and supports complex real estate contract procedures such as solving guarantor issues, helping students find their desired form of housing in Tokyo. This systematic and stable housing support provides psychological stability especially for students coming to Japan for the first time and becomes an essential element for a successful study abroad experience.
