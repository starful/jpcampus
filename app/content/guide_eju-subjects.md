# Navigating the EJU: A Comprehensive Guide to Subjects and Strategies for Success

For many international students, the dream of studying at a top-tier Japanese university begins with a single, pivotal examination: the **EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students)**. Managed by JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization), this exam is the standard benchmark used by nearly all national and many private universities to evaluate the academic abilities of international applicants.

While the Japanese language section is a major hurdle, the "Subject Tests"—**Japan and the World**, **Science**, and **Mathematics**—are often what distinguish the top candidates. These subjects are designed to mirror the Japanese high school curriculum, which might differ significantly from what you have studied in your home country.

In this deep-dive guide, we will break down the scope of each EJU subject, explore the specific topics you need to master, and provide actionable study tips to help you secure a high score.

## 1. Understanding the EJU Structure: An Overview

Before we dive into the specific subjects, it is important to understand how the EJU is organized. Unlike some standardized tests where you take every section, the EJU allows you to choose subjects based on the requirements of the university faculty you are applying to.

### EJU Subject Overview Table

| Subject | Duration | Score Range | Primary Target Audience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Japanese as a Foreign Language** | 125 mins | 0–400 (Reading/Listening) + 0–50 (Writing) | All applicants |
| **Japan and the World** | 80 mins | 0–200 | Liberal Arts / Humanities / Social Science majors |
| **Science (Choose 2 of 3)** | 80 mins | 0–200 | Science / Engineering / Medicine / Pharmacy majors |
| **Mathematics (Course 1 or 2)** | 80 mins | 0–200 | Course 1 (Humanities) / Course 2 (Science) |

*Note: You cannot take both "Japan and the World" and "Science" in the same exam session.*

## 2. Japan and the World (General Subject)

The **Japan and the World (総合科目 - Sōgō Kamoku)** subject is unique. It is an integrated test that combines geography, history, politics, and economics, specifically through the lens of modern society and Japan’s international relations.

### The Scope of the Exam
The goal of this subject is to measure whether a student has the basic knowledge required to study humanities at a Japanese university and the ability to think logically about global issues.

1.  **Modern Society (Politics and Economy):**
    *   **Democracy and Human Rights:** Development of modern political systems, the Japanese Constitution, and international human rights.
    *   **Modern Economy:** Market mechanisms, economic growth, inflation/deflation, and the role of the central bank.
    *   **International Relations:** The United Nations, the Cold War and its aftermath, and regional conflicts.
2.  **Geography:**
    *   **Global Environment:** Climate zones, topography, and natural disasters.
    *   **Resources and Industry:** Global energy issues, agricultural patterns, and the distribution of mineral resources.
    *   **Japan’s Geography:** Regional characteristics of Japan, population density, and urban development.
3.  **History:**
    *   **Modern History:** The Industrial Revolution, the World Wars, and the development of the modern nation-state.
    *   **Japanese History (Post-Edo):** The Meiji Restoration, Japan's modernization, and post-war economic recovery.

### Study Tips for Japan and the World
*   **Focus on Interconnectivity:** Don't study history and geography in isolation. Understand how the geography of a region (like the Middle East) influences its economy (oil) and its politics (regional conflicts).
*   **Master the Vocabulary:** Even if you take the test in English, knowing the Japanese terms for "Inflation," "Constitution," or "Meiji Restoration" is helpful because many study materials are in Japanese.
*   **Stay Current:** Read news regarding Japan’s current economic status and its diplomatic relations with neighboring countries. The EJU often includes questions that touch upon contemporary global trends.
*   **Use High School Textbooks:** The best resources are the "Geography B" and "Politics/Economy" textbooks used by Japanese high school students.

## 3. Science: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology

Students applying for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or medical fields must choose **two** out of the three science subjects. 

### Physics (物理)
The EJU Physics syllabus is rigorous and emphasizes understanding concepts over simple rote memorization.
*   **Mechanics:** Motion, force, energy, momentum, and circular motion.
*   **Thermodynamics:** Heat, temperature, and the kinetic theory of gases.
*   **Waves:** Sound, light, and wave interference.
*   **Electricity and Magnetism:** Electric fields, circuits, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic induction.
*   **Atomic Physics:** Structure of the atom, nuclei, and elementary particles.

**Study Tip:** Practice drawing free-body diagrams for mechanics. Many EJU questions require you to visualize the forces acting on a system before you apply any formulas.

### Chemistry (化学)
Chemistry is often considered the most balanced of the three, requiring both calculation skills and factual memorization.
*   **Theoretical Chemistry:** Atomic structure, chemical bonding, states of matter, thermochemistry, and chemical equilibrium.
*   **Inorganic Chemistry:** Properties of elements, metallic elements, and non-metallic elements.
*   **Organic Chemistry:** Structure and reactions of organic compounds, polymers, and biochemical substances.

**Study Tip:** Memorize the colors of precipitates and the properties of different gases. EJU Chemistry often features qualitative analysis questions where you must identify a substance based on its reaction characteristics.

### Biology (生物)
Biology is content-heavy and requires a deep understanding of biological processes.
*   **Cell and Molecules:** Cell structure, metabolism, and genetic information (DNA/RNA).
*   **Reproduction and Development:** Meiosis, animal development, and plant development.
*   **Homeostasis:** The nervous system, endocrine system, and immunity.
*   **Environment and Evolution:** Ecosystems, animal behavior, and the origins of life.

**Study Tip:** Create mind maps for complex systems like the human immune response or the citric acid cycle. Visualizing how different components interact is key to answering high-level EJU biology questions.

### Comparison Table: Science Subject Selection

| Major | Recommended Subject 1 | Recommended Subject 2 | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Engineering** | Physics | Chemistry | Essential for material science and mechanics. |
| **Medicine/Pharmacy** | Chemistry | Biology | Foundational for biochemistry and anatomy. |
| **Computer Science** | Physics | Chemistry/Biology | Physics develops logical modeling skills. |
| **Environmental Science** | Biology | Chemistry | Critical for understanding ecology and toxins. |

## 4. Mathematics: Course 1 vs. Course 2

Mathematics is often the "make-or-break" subject for EJU candidates. It is divided into two levels based on your intended major.

### Mathematics Course 1 (Liberal Arts)
Designed for students in the humanities, this course covers basic high school mathematics.
*   **Numbers and Sets:** Rational/irrational numbers and logic.
*   **Quadratic Functions:** Graphs, maximum/minimum values, and inequalities.
*   **Geometry:** Properties of triangles and circles, trigonometry (Sine/Cosine rules).
*   **Permutations and Probability:** Basic counting and probability theory.

### Mathematics Course 2 (Science)
This is a significantly more advanced level intended for science and engineering students. It includes everything in Course 1 plus:
*   **Advanced Algebra:** Complex numbers and the complex plane.
*   **Calculus:** Differentiation and integration (including trigonometric and exponential functions).
*   **Vectors:** Space vectors and vector geometry.
*   **Sequences:** Arithmetic, geometric, and mathematical induction.

### Study Tips for EJU Mathematics
*   **Understand the Format:** EJU Math is a "fill-in-the-box" (mark-sheet) format. You don't get partial credit for the process; the final answer must be correct.
*   **Speed is Key:** You have 80 minutes to solve several complex problems. Practice timed drills to ensure you don't spend too long on a single section.
*   **Learn Japanese Math Notation:** There are subtle differences in how math is written in Japan compared to Western systems. Familiarize yourself with these to avoid confusion during the exam.
*   **Focus on Functions:** Quadratic functions and trigonometry form the basis of many questions in both courses. Ensure your foundation in these areas is rock-solid.

## 5. General Strategies for EJU Success

Success in the EJU isn't just about knowing the material; it's about strategy. Here are four expert tips to elevate your preparation.

### 1. Analyze Past Papers (Kako-mon)
JASSO publishes past exam papers. These are your most valuable resources. Solve them under timed conditions to get a feel for the pacing. You will notice that certain types of questions (e.g., probability in Math or the "Meiji Era" in History) appear frequently.

### 2. Bridge the Curriculum Gap
If you are coming from an A-Level, IB, or SAT background, you might find that some EJU topics were never covered in your school. For example, "Organic Polymers" in Chemistry or "Modern Japanese History" are often more detailed in the EJU. Identify these gaps early and use targeted Japanese reference books like the *Chart System* (Chāto Shiki) series to fill them.

### 3. Language Choice Matters
You can choose to take the EJU (except for the Japanese subject) in either English or Japanese. 
*   **Choose English if:** Your Japanese level is still developing, and you want to ensure you understand the complex scientific/mathematical phrasing.
*   **Choose Japanese if:** You plan to attend a university where the entrance exams and interviews are strictly in Japanese. Learning the terminology now will give you a massive head start.

### 4. Manage Your Mental Health
The EJU is a high-stakes exam, and the pressure can be intense. Remember to balance your study sessions with physical activity and adequate sleep. A tired brain cannot solve complex calculus or remember the intricacies of international trade laws.
