The specific subjects required will depend on the department (e.g., arts for the Faculty of Fine Arts, music for the Faculty of Music).
*   **Portfolio Submission:** A high-quality portfolio is crucial for demonstrating artistic skill and potential. The portfolio should showcase a diverse range of work that reflects the applicant's abilities and interests.

**Student Support:**

However, the university provides assistance with visa applications, housing, and other practical matters. The international student office offers guidance and support to help international students adjust to life in Japan. Academic advising is available within each department, providing students with guidance on their studies and career goals. Counseling services are also available to help students cope with academic or personal challenges.

**Campus Life & Diversity:**

The number of international students at Tokyo University of the Arts is relatively small compared to other universities in Japan. This reflects the specialized nature of the university and the high level of Japanese language proficiency required for admission. While the campus may not be as diverse as some other institutions, the international students who do attend Geidai contribute to a vibrant and multicultural environment. Student clubs and organizations offer opportunities for students to connect with like-minded individuals and pursue their interests.
