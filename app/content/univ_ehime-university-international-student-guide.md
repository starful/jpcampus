## 🏫 University Overview

Ehime University (愛媛大学, Ehime Daigaku), colloquially known as "Aidai," is a leading national university located in Matsuyama, the largest city on the island of Shikoku. Established in 1949, the university has grown into a comprehensive institution that prides itself on being a "student-centered university" that contributes significantly to the local community while maintaining a high level of global research prominence. For international students, Ehime University offers a unique blend of high-quality Japanese national education, cutting-edge research facilities, and a living environment that is significantly more affordable and relaxed than the bustling metropolises of Tokyo or Osaka.

The university's philosophy is rooted in "Regional Sustainability," and it serves as a primary hub for intellectual and industrial development in the Seto Inland Sea region. It operates across three main campuses in Matsuyama: the Johoku Campus (the main hub for most faculties), the Tarumi Campus (Agriculture), and the Shigenobu Campus (Medicine). Each campus is equipped with modern facilities, green spaces, and a welcoming atmosphere that facilitates close interaction between students and faculty members.

## 🎓 Academic Excellence and Specialized Research

What sets Ehime University apart from many other regional national universities is its world-class research centers. The university is home to several institutions that are leaders in their respective fields:

1.  **Geodynamics Research Center (GRC):** This center is world-renowned for its research on the Earth's deep interior. It is famous for synthesizing the "Hime-Dia" (Ehime Diamond), the world's hardest synthetic diamond, which is used in high-pressure experiments to simulate conditions at the Earth's core.
2.  **Proteo-Science Center (PROS):** A pioneer in protein science, this center utilizes a unique cell-free protein synthesis system to advance medical research, drug discovery, and biotechnology.
3.  **Center for Marine Environmental Studies (CMES):** Located near the Seto Inland Sea, this center conducts critical research on global environmental pollutants and marine ecology, attracting researchers from all over the world.

For undergraduate and graduate students, the university offers a wide range of programs. The **Faculty of Collaborative Regional Innovation** is particularly noteworthy for international students interested in how academic theory is applied to solve real-world regional issues, from local business management to disaster prevention. The **Faculty of Engineering** and **Faculty of Science** also provide robust pathways for students looking to enter Japan's high-tech industries.

## 🌏 International Student Support and Environment

Ehime University is highly dedicated to internationalization. The **Institute for International Relations (IIR)** serves as the primary support system for foreign students, offering comprehensive services ranging from visa assistance to psychological counseling and academic advising. 

### Japanese Language Support
The university provides intensive and supplementary Japanese language courses. Whether you are an undergraduate student entering through the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) or a research student, there are levels ranging from absolute beginner to advanced N1+ business Japanese. 

### The "Global Partner" System
To help new arrivals adjust to life in Matsuyama, the university pairs international students with Japanese student "tutors" or "Global Partners." These partners help with administrative tasks like city hall registration and opening bank accounts, but more importantly, they become first friends, facilitating cultural exchange and language practice.

## 🏠 Campus Life and Living in Matsuyama

One of the biggest advantages of studying at Ehime University is its location. Matsuyama is a "compact city" with a rich historical background, famous for the Dogo Onsen (one of Japan's oldest hot springs) and Matsuyama Castle. 

### Cost of Living
The cost of living in Matsuyama is approximately 30-40% lower than in Tokyo. A private apartment near the Johoku campus can range from 30,000 to 50,000 JPY per month, which is unthinkable in Japan's larger cities. The city is very flat, making it a "bicycle city" where most students commute entirely by bike, saving on transportation costs.

### Housing
International students have access to the **Ehime University International House** (Kasumi-cho), which offers affordable dormitory-style living for the first year. This allows students to stabilize their lives before moving into private apartments. There are also specialized dormitories for female students and medical students.

## 📈 Admissions for International Students

Admission to Ehime University is competitive but accessible for dedicated students. 

1.  **Undergraduate Admissions:** Most faculties require the **EJU**. Requirements typically include Japanese as a Foreign Language, Science/Mathematics, or Japan and the World, depending on the faculty. A high score in Japanese is essential, as most undergraduate lectures are conducted in Japanese.
2.  **English-Taught Programs:** While most undergraduate courses are in Japanese, several graduate programs in Engineering, Agriculture, and Science offer English-medium pathways, particularly for Masters and PhD candidates.
3.  **Scholarships:** The university offers various internal scholarship recommendations for the MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship, the JASSO honors scholarship, and several private foundation grants (such as the Nakajima Foundation or the Rotary Yoneyama Memorial Foundation) specifically designated for students in the Ehime region.

## 💼 Career Prospects and Local Industry

Ehime University has a stellar reputation for job placement. The **Career Support Center** provides tailored guidance for international students, including workshops on Japanese business etiquette, resume writing, and mock interviews. 

Because the university has such strong ties with local industries—ranging from shipbuilding and chemical manufacturing to agriculture (Ehime is Japan's 'Citrus Kingdom') and IT—many international students find employment within the prefecture. However, the prestige of being a national university graduate also opens doors to major corporations in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. For those interested in research, the university's strong ties with international labs provide a clear pathway to global academic careers.

## 🍊 Why Choose Ehime University?

Choosing Ehime University means choosing a balance between academic rigor and a high quality of life. It is ideal for students who want to truly immerse themselves in Japanese culture without the overwhelming stress of a mega-city. You will receive a world-class education, particularly in the sciences and engineering, while being surrounded by the natural beauty of the Seto Inland Sea and the warm hospitality of the Shikoku people.

For the student who values research impact, community involvement, and a supportive, close-knit academic environment, Ehime University is an exceptional choice that offers the 'real' Japan experience alongside top-tier educational standards.
