Its pioneering work in bluefin tuna cultivation, famously known as "Kindai Tuna," has revolutionized the industry and brought the university international acclaim. This achievement highlights Kindai University's commitment to advancing knowledge and applying research to solve real-world problems. A focus on practical application defines the Kindai University experience.

## International Student Admissions & Life

The application process for international students at Kindai University typically involves several steps. Generally, prospective students must demonstrate Japanese language proficiency, often through the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU).

Specific score requirements vary by program, so it's important to check the individual faculty or department guidelines. The application usually includes submitting:

*   Academic transcripts.
*   Letters of recommendation.
*   A statement of purpose.
*   Other supporting documents.

Some programs may also require an interview, either in person or via video conference. The acceptance rate is around 35%, indicating a selective admissions process.

While some programs at the graduate level may be offered entirely in English (particularly within the Faculty of International Studies, and specific courses in other faculties), there are limited undergraduate degree programs available entirely in English at Kindai University. Students interested in pursuing a degree in English should carefully review the program descriptions on the university's website or contact the international student office for detailed information. The university is continuously working to expand its English-taught offerings.

Kindai University provides a range of support services for its international student population, which numbers around 1200. The International Center serves as a central hub for international students, offering assistance with:

The center also provides counseling services to help students adjust to life in Japan and address any personal or academic challenges they may face.
