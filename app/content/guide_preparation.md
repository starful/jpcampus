title: 'Pre-departure Checklist: What to Pack'
---

Embarking on your study abroad adventure in Japan is an exciting step! But before you can immerse yourself in Japanese culture, master the language, and excel in your studies, you need to pack. Packing smart is crucial for a smooth transition. This guide provides a comprehensive pre-departure checklist to ensure you have everything you need for a successful start to your Japanese student life. Careful preparation will save you time, money, and stress upon arrival, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: your education and experiencing Japan!

## Must-Have Items for Japan

These are the items you absolutely cannot leave home without. They are essential for navigating initial administrative tasks and settling into your new life.

### Hanko/Inkan (Personal Seal)

The *hanko*, also known as *inkan*, is a personal seal used in Japan for official documents, banking, and even receiving packages. While many institutions now accept signatures, a *hanko* is still widely used and considered a more formal and secure method of authentication.

**Why is a Hanko so Important?**

*   **Official Documents:** You'll need it for opening a bank account, signing rental agreements, registering at the ward office, and potentially even at your university.
*   **Security:** Hankos are registered, adding an extra layer of security.
*   **Cultural Significance:** Using a *hanko* shows respect for Japanese customs.

**Should you buy one in Japan or bring one from home?**

While you *can* purchase a *hanko* in Japan, having one made beforehand can save you time and hassle, especially during the initial settling-in period. Consider having one made with your name in *katakana* (Japanese phonetic alphabet used for foreign words). Several online retailers offer *hanko* creation services. If purchasing in Japan, remember that red ink pads are the standard.

### Cash (Japanese Yen)

While credit cards are becoming more widely accepted, Japan is still largely a cash-based society, especially in smaller towns and for certain transactions like transportation on local buses or entrance fees to smaller attractions.

**How much cash should you bring?**

*   **Initial Expenses:** Enough to cover your first month's rent (if not already paid), deposit, transportation from the airport, groceries, and initial setup costs (SIM card, basic household items).
*   **Emergency Fund:** Always have a backup in case of unforeseen circumstances.

A good starting point is around ¥100,000 to ¥200,000 (approximately $700 to $1400 USD), depending on your living arrangements and lifestyle. Exchange currency before you leave, but also consider withdrawing some cash upon arrival at the airport ATM for immediate needs. Inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any issues with your debit card.

### Plug Adapter

Japan uses Type A and Type B electrical outlets, which have two flat pins. The voltage is 100V. If your electronic devices use a different plug type or voltage, you'll need a plug adapter and potentially a voltage converter.

**What kind of adapter should you get?**

*   **Plug Adapter:** A simple adapter to change the shape of your plug to fit the Japanese outlets.
*   **Voltage Converter:** If your devices operate on a different voltage (e.g., 220V), you'll need a converter to avoid damaging them. Most modern laptops, phones, and tablets have built-in voltage converters, but always check the specifications on the device or its charger.

A universal adapter is a convenient option, as it can be used in multiple countries. You can find these at most electronics stores or online.

## Essential Documents

Keep these documents organized and easily accessible. Consider making photocopies and storing them separately from the originals. Digital copies on a secure cloud storage service are also a good idea.

### Certificate of Eligibility (COE)

This is arguably the most important document you'll need. The COE is issued by the Japanese Immigration Bureau and is required to apply for your student visa.

**What to do with your COE:**

*   **Keep it safe:** It's essential for your visa application and entry into Japan.
*   **Present it to the embassy/consulate:** When applying for your student visa.
*   **Carry it with you when you enter Japan:** Immigration officials will need to see it.

Without a valid COE, you will not be able to obtain a student visa and enter Japan to study.

### Letter of Admission from Your University

This letter confirms your acceptance into the university and contains important information about your program, enrollment procedures, and contact details.

**Why is the Admission Letter Important?**

*   **Proof of Enrollment:** You may need it for visa extensions or other administrative purposes.
*   **University Information:** It contains contact information for your department or international student office.
*   **Arrival Instructions:** It may include specific instructions for arrival and orientation.

Keep this letter in a safe place and refer to it for any questions you have about your program or the university.

### Passport and Visa

Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay in Japan. Apply for your student visa as soon as you receive your COE and admission letter.

**Important Passport and Visa Tips:**

*   **Passport Validity:** Ensure your passport has at least six months of validity remaining.
*   **Visa Type:** Make sure you have the correct visa type (student visa).
*   **Photocopies:** Keep photocopies of your passport and visa separate from the originals.
*   **Digital Copies:** Store digital copies securely.

### Other Important Documents

*   **Travel Insurance Information:** Policy number, contact details, and coverage details.
*   **Medical Records and Prescriptions:** If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or require medication. Bring a doctor's note stating your condition and the medication you need.
*   **Emergency Contact Information:** Names, phone numbers, and email addresses of your emergency contacts.
*   **Financial Documents:** Bank statements, scholarship letters, or any other documents proving your financial resources.

## Clothing and Personal Items

Packing the right clothing will ensure you are comfortable in Japan's varied climate and can adapt to different social situations.

### Clothing

Japan experiences four distinct seasons, so pack accordingly. Research the typical weather conditions for the region you'll be living in.

**General Clothing Recommendations:**

*   **Versatile Clothing:** Choose items that can be mixed and matched.
*   **Layering:** Essential for adjusting to temperature changes.
*   **Comfortable Shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking.
*   **Formal Attire:** For university events, job interviews, or special occasions.

**Seasonal Considerations:**

*   **Spring (March-May):** Light jackets, sweaters, long-sleeved shirts, and comfortable pants.
*   **Summer (June-August):** Lightweight, breathable clothing, such as cotton or linen. Shorts are acceptable in casual settings.
*   **Autumn (September-November):** Similar to spring, but with warmer layers.
*   **Winter (December-February):** Warm coats, sweaters, scarves, gloves, and hats. Consider thermal underwear.

**Footwear:**

Japanese people often remove their shoes when entering homes, temples, and some traditional restaurants. Easy-to-slip-on shoes or slippers are convenient.

### Medications and Toiletries

If you take any prescription medications, bring an adequate supply for your initial stay, along with a doctor's note and prescription in English. Be aware of Japanese regulations regarding certain medications, as some are prohibited or require special permits. Check with the Japanese embassy or consulate in your country for more information.

**Toiletries:**

You can purchase most toiletries in Japan, but if you have specific preferences or allergies, it's best to bring your own. Travel-sized toiletries are useful for your journey.

**What to consider packing:**

*   **Medications:** Enough for the beginning of your stay with a doctor's note.
*   **Specific Brands:** If you have sensitivities to certain brands.
*   **Travel Sizes:** For the initial travel, and ease of carrying.

### Electronics

Don't forget your essential electronics and accessories.

**Electronics Checklist:**

*   **Laptop/Tablet:** For studying, communication, and entertainment.
*   **Smartphone:** For communication, navigation, and accessing information.
*   **Chargers:** For all your devices.
*   **Portable Charger:** Useful for long days on campus or traveling.
*   **Headphones:** For studying or listening to music on the go.
*   **Portable Hard Drive/USB Drive:** For backing up important files.

Consider purchasing a Japanese SIM card or pocket Wi-Fi router for internet access.

## Other Helpful Items

These items may not be essential, but they can make your life in Japan more comfortable and convenient.

### Gifts for Host Families or New Acquaintances

Bringing small gifts from your home country is a thoughtful gesture when meeting host families, professors, or new friends. Souvenirs, local snacks, or crafts are all good options. The act of giving is important, so don't worry about expensive gifts.

### Photos of Family and Friends

Having photos of loved ones can help you feel more connected to home, especially during times of homesickness.

### Language Learning Resources

Bring any textbooks, dictionaries, or other language learning materials you find helpful. While you can purchase these in Japan, having them on hand when you arrive can be beneficial.

### Comfort Items

A favorite blanket, pillow, or other small comfort items can help you feel more at home in your new surroundings.
