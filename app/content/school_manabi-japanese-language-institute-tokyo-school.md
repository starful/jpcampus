**Higher Education 2-Year Course:** This is the most comprehensive program, designed for students with little to no prior knowledge of Japanese. Over two years, students build a strong foundation in all aspects of the language, from basic grammar and vocabulary to advanced reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. The curriculum progressively integrates EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) preparation, covering all subjects tested in the exam. Teaching style emphasizes interactive learning, with a focus on practical application of language skills. Teachers use a variety of methods, including group discussions, role-playing, presentations, and multimedia resources to engage students and make learning fun and effective. Regular assessments and feedback help students track their progress and identify areas for improvement. Cultural activities and field trips are also incorporated to provide students with firsthand experience of Japanese culture and society.

**Higher Education 1-Year 9-Month Course:** This accelerated program is designed for students who want to quickly improve their Japanese language skills and prepare for university entrance within a shorter timeframe. The curriculum covers the same material as the 2-Year Course but at a faster pace. Teaching style is more intensive, with a greater emphasis on independent study and self-directed learning. Students are expected to actively participate in class and take responsibility for their own learning. Teachers provide guidance and support, but students are encouraged to take initiative and seek out opportunities to practice their Japanese language skills outside of the classroom. The course includes targeted EJU preparation sessions, focusing on exam strategies and practice questions.

**Higher Education 1-Year 6-Month Course:** This intensive course is geared towards students who need to acquire a high level of Japanese proficiency in a relatively short period. The curriculum is highly structured and focused on the essential skills needed for academic success. Teaching style is demanding, with a strong emphasis on grammar and vocabulary acquisition. Students are expected to dedicate significant time to studying outside of class. The course includes regular mock exams to simulate the EJU exam environment and help students build confidence. This course assumes the student has some basic foundation, making its accelerated format effective.

**Higher Education 1-Year 3-Month Course:** This program represents the most accelerated option, catering to students who possess a foundational understanding of Japanese and are committed to intensive study to achieve proficiency for higher education entry. The curriculum swiftly covers advanced grammatical structures, nuanced vocabulary, and sophisticated reading comprehension. The teaching approach is highly focused, demanding active participation and independent learning. A large part of the curriculum is dedicated to EJU preparation, providing test-taking strategies and rigorous practice. This course requires significant dedication and self-discipline.

**Higher Education 1-Year Course:** This course balances intensive language learning with EJU preparation. The curriculum covers essential grammar, vocabulary, and kanji, while integrating practical application of these skills in everyday situations. This enables students to use their knowledge in tangible settings, as well as to master the language needed to succeed in higher education. Teachers encourage interactive learning and actively engage with students, creating a comfortable environment for students to ask questions and actively participate. They provide guidance and personalized feedback.
