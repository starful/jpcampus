## 🏫 University Overview
Meiji Gakuin University (MGU) stands as one of Japan’s most prestigious and historic private liberal arts institutions. Founded in 1863 by Dr. James Curtis Hepburn—the missionary and physician famous for creating the Hepburn Romanization system for the Japanese language—the university is deeply rooted in Christian principles. Its educational philosophy is encapsulated in the motto, "Do for Others." This isn't just a catchy phrase; it is the guiding light for the university’s curriculum, volunteering initiatives, and international exchange programs. With campuses in the heart of Tokyo (Shirokane) and the scenic hills of Yokohama, MGU offers a unique blend of historical charm and modern academic rigor. For international students, it represents a gateway to Japanese society that prioritizes social responsibility and global citizenship over mere rote learning.

## 🎓 Academic Excellence and Faculties
Meiji Gakuin is composed of six faculties, each offering a distinct approach to the humanities and social sciences. 

1. **Faculty of Letters**: This is the heart of the university’s liberal arts tradition. It includes departments of English, French, and Art History. The English department is particularly famous, given the university's origins, and focuses heavily on both literature and linguistic proficiency.
2. **Faculty of Economics**: Known for its practical approach, this faculty offers departments in Economics and Business Administration. It bridges the gap between theoretical economic models and the real-world business environment of Tokyo.
3. **Faculty of Sociology**: This faculty encourages students to look at the 'why' behind social structures. It is highly regarded for its research in social welfare and media studies.
4. **Faculty of Law**: Unlike some law programs that focus purely on the bar exam, MGU’s Law faculty emphasizes the role of law in protecting human rights and social justice, aligning with the "Do for Others" motto.
5. **Faculty of International Studies**: Perhaps the most popular choice for foreign students. It houses the Department of Global and Transcultural Studies (GTS), which offers many courses in English and focuses on globalization, conflict resolution, and cultural exchange.
6. **Faculty of Psychology**: This is one of the more competitive faculties at MGU, known for its clinical psychology training and state-of-the-art research facilities.

## 🌍 The International Experience
For international students, the **Department of Global and Transcultural Studies (GTS)** is the jewel in the crown. It offers a liberal arts curriculum where students can engage in high-level discussions on international relations and sociology primarily in English, while simultaneously mastering the Japanese language. MGU maintains exchange agreements with over 50 universities worldwide, including prestigious institutions in the US, UK, and Europe. This creates a vibrant, multicultural atmosphere on campus. The International Center provides robust support, helping students with everything from visa renewals to finding local homestays. The university also organizes "Global Lounge" events where Japanese and international students interact in a casual setting, breaking down cultural barriers through language exchange and social activities.

## 📍 Campus Life: Shirokane and Yokohama
MGU operates on a two-campus system. Generally, students spend their first two years at the **Yokohama Campus** and their final two years at the **Shirokane Campus**.

- **Shirokane Campus (Minato-ku, Tokyo)**: This is one of the most beautiful urban campuses in Japan. It features several buildings designated as Tangible Cultural Properties, including the Shirokane Chapel and the Hepburn Hall. Located in one of Tokyo’s most upscale districts, it provides students with proximity to major business hubs and cultural landmarks. The atmosphere is sophisticated and peaceful, providing an ideal environment for senior-level research.
- **Yokohama Campus (Totsuka, Yokohama)**: This campus is characterized by its greenery and open spaces. It is a more modern facility designed to foster community among underclassmen. The "Calm" student lounge and the extensive library facilities make it a comfortable place for students to transition into university life.

## 📝 Admissions for International Students
Admission to Meiji Gakuin for international students typically follows two paths: the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)** track or the **English-language program** track (specifically for GTS).

- **EJU Track**: Most faculties require a strong score in Japanese as a Foreign Language, along with Japan and the World (social studies) and Mathematics. A JLPT N1 or high N2 level is usually the baseline for success in the interview process. The entrance exam often includes a short essay (小論文) and an interview where your motivation and understanding of the "Do for Others" philosophy are tested.
- **GTS English Track**: For this program, applicants are evaluated based on English proficiency scores (TOEFL/IELTS), academic transcripts, and personal statements. It is an excellent option for students who are not yet fluent in Japanese but wish to study in Tokyo.

## 💼 Career Prospects and Employment Support
Meiji Gakuin has a stellar reputation among Japanese employers, particularly in the fields of finance, aviation, education, and NGOs. The Career Center is exceptionally active, offering specialized guidance for international students who wish to work in Japan. Because MGU students are known for their high ethical standards and communication skills, they are highly sought after by companies looking for employees who can bridge the gap between Japan and the global market. The university hosts frequent job fairs and networking events where students can meet alumni working in top-tier firms. For those looking to work in international development or social work, MGU’s network is arguably one of the strongest in the Kanto region.

## 💰 Financial Considerations
While private universities in Japan are more expensive than national ones, Meiji Gakuin is fairly priced for the quality of education and location. The first-year costs typically include an admission fee of 200,000 JPY and tuition/fees totaling approximately 1,150,000 to 1,400,000 JPY depending on the faculty. However, MGU offers a variety of internal scholarships specifically for international students, including tuition reductions of 30% for those with high academic performance and financial need. Additionally, students are eligible to apply for the MEXT scholarship and the JASSO honors scholarship through university recommendation.

## ✨ Why Choose Meiji Gakuin?
Choosing a university is about more than just rankings; it’s about finding a community that aligns with your values. Meiji Gakuin University is perfect for the student who wants to be more than just a number. If you are interested in the humanities, social justice, and international relations, and you want to study in a setting that values the individual, MGU is a premier choice. Its historic Tokyo location, combined with its forward-thinking global outlook, ensures that graduates leave not just with a degree, but with a refined sense of their place in the world. Whether you are walking through the ivy-covered gates of Shirokane or engaging in a heated debate in a GTS seminar, Meiji Gakuin offers a transformative experience that prepares you to truly "Do for Others."
