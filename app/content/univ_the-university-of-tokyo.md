## 🌍 International Student Admissions & Life

The application process for international students at the University of Tokyo typically involves several stages.

In addition to the EJU, applicants must also submit scores from either the **TOEFL iBT or IELTS Academic** exam to demonstrate their English proficiency. Some programs may also require applicants to take subject-specific entrance examinations. Graduate programs generally require a bachelor's degree from a recognized university and may also require GRE scores, depending on the department.

For programs offered entirely in English, such as the EPEE and PEAK programs at the undergraduate level and G30 programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels, the application requirements may differ slightly. While the EJU is not usually required for these programs, strong English proficiency scores (TOEFL iBT or IELTS Academic) are essential. Applicants may also be required to submit essays, letters of recommendation, and participate in interviews. The selection process is highly competitive, and admission is based on a holistic assessment of the applicant's academic record, test scores, personal statement, and potential for success.
