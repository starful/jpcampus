## University Overview

Osaka Metropolitan University (OMU) marks a new era in Japanese higher education. Established in April 2022 through the merger of Osaka City University (OCU) and Osaka Prefecture University (OPU), OMU stands as Japan's largest public university, rivaling the scope and comprehensiveness of leading national universities. This strategic unification, driven by the Osaka prefectural and municipal governments, aims to consolidate resources, bolster global competitiveness, and concentrate research efforts on addressing significant urban and global challenges.

## The Power of Merger: OMU's Identity

The merger unites over 140 years of academic heritage from OCU and OPU, blending their distinct strengths: OCU's prominence in urban studies, humanities, and social sciences, with OPU's excellence in engineering, agriculture, and applied sciences. OMU now operates across an extensive network of campuses, including the administrative hub at Sugimoto (formerly OCU), the core science and engineering campus at Nakamozu (formerly OPU), and specialized facilities like the Abeno campus for Medicine. This geographical and academic breadth enables OMU to offer an unparalleled diversity of subjects, from cutting-edge Veterinary Science to highly specialized Urban Management.

## Location and Environment

Located in Osaka, the economic and cultural center of the Kansai region, OMU provides international students with a vibrant learning environment. Osaka is known for its accessibility, dynamic culture, lower cost of living compared to Tokyo, and ample employment opportunities. The campuses are strategically situated throughout the metropolitan area, fostering strong connections with local industries and municipal organizations. OMU graduates greatly benefit from this close relationship, resulting in excellent post-graduation employment rates within the competitive Kansai market.

## Rankings and Research Profile

As a relatively young institution, OMU is quickly ascending international rankings, building upon the established research excellence of its predecessor institutions. It is recognized domestically as a top-tier public university (Kōritsu Daigaku). OMU emphasizes interdisciplinary research, particularly in sustainable development, advanced materials science, and medical innovation. The university aspires to be a global hub for research that directly impacts metropolitan life and sustainable societal systems.

## Faculties & Departments

Osaka Metropolitan University is divided into 12 distinct Faculties (undergraduate colleges) and 15 Graduate Schools, reflecting its comprehensive nature. International applicants should be aware that most undergraduate instruction is conducted in Japanese, requiring a high level of proficiency.

### Humanities, Social Sciences, and Business

*   **Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences:** Offers in-depth studies in philosophy, history, archaeology, sociology, and various language literatures. This faculty emphasizes critical thinking and cultural analysis, drawing heavily on OCU's legacy in urban humanities.
*   **Faculty of Law:** A highly respected program focusing on public, private, and international law, preparing students for legal careers and public service. It emphasizes constitutional studies relevant to metropolitan governance.
*   **Faculty of Economics & Faculty of Business:** These faculties are central to OMU's mission, training future leaders in finance, accounting, global business strategy, and economic policy, with a strong emphasis on data analytics and urban economics.
*   **Faculty of Urban Management:** A unique feature of OMU, this faculty focuses on modern challenges facing mega-cities, including infrastructure planning, public policy, environmental sustainability, and disaster preparedness.

### Science, Technology, and Applied Fields (STEM)

*   **Faculty of Science:** Comprehensive fundamental sciences, including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics. The facilities are state-of-the-art, particularly in materials science and theoretical physics research.
*   **Faculty of Engineering:** OMU is a powerhouse in engineering, covering vast domains such as Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Aerospace, and Materials Engineering. The programs are intensely research-focused, leveraging strong industrial connections established by OPU.
*   **Faculty of Sustainable System Science:** A future-oriented faculty integrating computer science, data intelligence, and environmental engineering to design environmentally conscious technologies and smart urban systems.

### Medical and Life Sciences

*   **Faculty of Veterinary Science:** One of Japan's most distinguished veterinary programs, based at the Rinku Campus, focusing on animal health, food safety, and infectious disease control, offering exceptional opportunities for hands-on experience.
*   **Faculty of Human Life Science:** This multidisciplinary faculty examines the human condition through lenses like nutrition, child development, social welfare, and lifestyle design.

### Graduate School Opportunities (English Programs)

While undergraduate studies require Japanese fluency, OMU has been steadily increasing its offering of English-taught programs at the Graduate level, particularly in Engineering, Information Science, and specialized fields like the "Global Human Resources Development Program" (GHRP).

## International Student Support

OMU is deeply committed to supporting its diverse international student body, which is integrated across undergraduate and graduate levels. Support services focus on linguistic, financial, and cultural acclimatization.

### Japanese Language and Cultural Integration

OMU provides comprehensive Japanese language courses tailored for international students who are preparing for or currently enrolled in degree programs. These courses often focus on academic Japanese necessary for research and thesis writing. Furthermore, the International Center organizes cultural exchange events, tutoring programs, and mentorship pairings with local students to ease the transition into Japanese university life.

### Housing Assistance and Dormitories

Securing affordable housing is crucial in Osaka, and OMU provides several options:

*   **International Student Dormitories:** OMU manages specific dormitories, such as those near the Sugimoto and Nakamozu campuses, offering reasonable rates and a supportive community environment. Priority is usually given to newly arrived MEXT and exchange students.
*   **Guaranteed Housing Programs:** The university often assists new international students by guaranteeing a limited number of slots in private housing designated for students, sometimes with reduced initial move-in costs.

### Scholarship Opportunities

Financial support is robust, making OMU an attractive choice for high-achieving international students:

*   **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship:** OMU is a favored institution for both embassy-recommended and university-recommended MEXT scholars, covering tuition, offering a monthly stipend, and travel expenses.
*   **JASSO Scholarship:** Students can apply for the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) stipend, which provides monthly financial aid to privately financed international students who maintain excellent academic performance.
*   **OMU-Specific Scholarships:** The university offers its own merit-based scholarships and hardship funds. These may include the **Osaka Public University Educational Foundation Scholarship** or specific departmental grants.
*   **Tuition Fee Waiver Program (Gakusei Seikatsu Shien):** OMU, like many public universities, offers a partial or full tuition exemption based on financial need and academic merit. Waivers are highly competitive but essential for many self-funded students.

## Tuition & Fees

As a public university, OMU offers significantly lower tuition rates compared to private institutions in Japan, making it an excellent value proposition for international study.

### Cost of Living in Osaka

Osaka provides a manageable cost of living compared to major global cities. Students should budget approximately ¥80,000 to ¥120,000 per month, covering rent, utilities, food, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses. OMU's robust transportation network allows students to live in more affordable areas surrounding the central campuses, further reducing housing costs. Furthermore, OMU actively helps international students navigate the part-time work permit process, allowing them to supplement their income legally.
