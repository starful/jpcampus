## University Overview

Yokohama City University (YCU), also known as 横浜市立大学, is a leading public municipal university located in Yokohama, Japan's second-largest city. Officially established in 1949, but with roots tracing back to institutions founded as early as 1882, YCU occupies a unique position among Japanese universities. As a public institution, it receives substantial funding from the Yokohama municipal government, allowing it to provide high-quality education and cutting-edge research opportunities at tuition rates considerably lower than those of most private universities. This makes YCU highly competitive both nationally and internationally.

## Strategic Location and Campus Life

YCU operates across several strategically located campuses. The main administrative and academic center is the Kanazawa-Hakkei Campus, which houses the faculties of International Relations, Data Science, and the Arts and Sciences programs. The Fukura Campus is home to the Medical School, providing a rigorous environment for life sciences and clinical training, while the Maioka Campus focuses on advanced research in immunology and regenerative medicine.

Studying at YCU offers unparalleled access to the resources, culture, and economic opportunities of the greater Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area, without the congestion and high costs typically associated with studying in central Tokyo. Yokohama is a global hub with a rich international history, making it an ideal living laboratory for students in economics, international relations, and cultural studies.

## Core Mission and Research Excellence

YCU's core mission is to contribute to the advancement of local society while cultivating a global perspective in its students. The university has made significant progress in specialized research fields, particularly in life sciences, medical technology, and the increasingly important area of data science. The establishment of the Faculty of Data Science marked YCU as a pioneer in integrating statistical and computational methods across traditional academic disciplines, demonstrating a commitment to adapting to the demands of the modern, data-driven world. Furthermore, its Advanced Medical Research Center is renowned for its breakthroughs in personalized medicine and fundamental biological research, attracting top scholars and offering state-of-the-art facilities.

## Faculties & Departments

Yokohama City University is structured to provide focused, interdisciplinary education across a limited number of specialized faculties. For international undergraduate applicants, the primary point of entry is through faculties that admit students based on the standard Japanese entrance system, typically requiring strong performance on the Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU).

*   **Faculty of International Relations:** Aims to develop professionals capable of analyzing complex global issues from multiple perspectives, including political science, law, economics, and cultural studies. Given Yokohama’s history as a port city and international gateway, the curriculum emphasizes practical field research, linguistic competence, and cross-cultural communication skills essential for careers in international organizations, diplomacy, and global business.
*   **Faculty of Data Science:** Launched in 2018, this faculty focuses on the mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations necessary to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful insights. Unlike typical Computer Science programs, YCU’s Data Science faculty emphasizes the application of data science to solve real-world problems in economics, healthcare, and urban planning, preparing students for roles in high-tech industries and advanced research.
*   **Faculty of Economics and Business Administration:** Prepares students for leadership roles in commerce and finance, covering classical and modern economics, business management, marketing, and accounting. The curriculum is tailored to address the dynamics of the Japanese and global economies, leveraging Yokohama’s strong corporate presence for internship and networking opportunities.
*   **School of Medicine:** This highly selective and nationally recognized school, including both the Department of Medicine and the Department of Nursing, excels in clinical training and biomedical research. The university's affiliated hospitals provide crucial hands-on experience. Admission to the medical program is exceptionally competitive, even among domestic applicants, and requires near-native proficiency in Japanese.

At the graduate level, YCU offers specialized programs, including the Graduate School of International Management (MBA programs, some with English tracks) and the Graduate School of Medical Life Science. These postgraduate programs often provide more flexibility and specific English-taught course options, particularly in research-intensive fields like Medical Science and specific areas within Data Science.

## International Student Support

YCU is committed to providing a supportive, welcoming environment for its international students. Support services are comprehensive, although Japanese proficiency remains crucial for daily life and most academic pursuits.

*   **Admission Requirements and EJU:** The primary entrance method for non-Japanese citizens for almost all undergraduate programs is the Special Admission for International Students, which requires submission of scores from the **Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU)**. Required subjects typically include Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics (Course 2), and General Subjects (for humanities) or Science (for medicine/data science). YCU typically seeks top-tier EJU scores, often requiring Japanese language proficiency equivalent to or approaching the N1 level of the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test).
*   **English-Taught Programs (Degree Seeking):** YCU primarily operates using Japanese as the medium of instruction. While some graduate programs, especially in specialized research fields or the International Management MBA, may offer coursework or research supervision entirely in English, degree-seeking undergraduate programs taught entirely in English are extremely limited or nonexistent. Prospective international students must be prepared for rigorous Japanese language study.
*   **Scholarships and Financial Aid:** As a public institution, YCU is already cost-effective, but it offers financial support to eligible international students:
    *   **Tuition Fee Waiver Program:** YCU offers a fee reduction and exemption system for both the admission fee and the yearly tuition fee based on academic merit and financial need. Waivers can cover 50% or 100% of the tuition.
    *   **YCU International Student Scholarship:** This grant supports the living expenses of outstanding international students.
    *   **JASSO Scholarship:** Eligible students can apply for the Japanese Government Scholarship (Monbukagakusho, MEXT) or the JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) Scholarship for privately funded students, providing a monthly stipend.
    *   **Local and Private Grants:** YCU assists students in applying for various scholarships sponsored by the Yokohama municipal government and private foundations.
*   **Accommodation:** YCU provides limited on-campus accommodation through its International Student House. However, due to high demand, most international students transition to private housing within Yokohama after their first year. The university provides guidance on securing apartments, understanding leasing procedures, and navigating the Japanese guarantor system.

## Tuition & Fees

Studying at Yokohama City University is attractive due to the subsidized fee structure typical of public Japanese universities. The costs listed below are standard for self-funded undergraduate students as of the current academic year, pending yearly revisions. These fees are significantly lower than those found at major private institutions in the Kanto region.

| Fee Category                      | Amount (JPY) | Notes                                                               |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admission Fee (Enrollment)**    | ¥282,000     | Paid only once upon entrance. Waivers available.                     |
| **Yearly Tuition Fee**            | ¥535,800     | Payable in two installments (Spring/Fall). Subject to fee waiver application. |
| **Total First Year Cost (Excl. Waivers)** | ¥817,800     | Approximately US $5,200 - $5,500 (depending on exchange rate).         |

*   **Additional Financial Considerations:**
    *   **Health Insurance:** Enrollment in the National Health Insurance (Kokumin Kenko Hoken) is mandatory, costing approximately ¥2,000–¥3,000 per month, providing coverage for 70% of medical costs.
    *   **Miscellaneous Fees:** Campus accident insurance, student council fees, and departmental registration fees typically add ¥20,000–¥40,000 to the first-year costs.
    *   **Living Expenses:** While Yokohama is less expensive than central Tokyo, the cost of living remains high. Monthly estimated expenses (rent, food, utilities, transportation) generally range from ¥100,000 to ¥150,000 depending on lifestyle and housing location.
