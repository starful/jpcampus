## 🏫 University Overview

Yokohama City University (YCU), or 横浜市立大学, stands as a leading public, municipal university situated in the heart of Japan's second-largest city, Yokohama. Established formally in 1949, tracing its roots back to institutions founded as early as 1882, YCU holds a distinct position among Japanese tertiary institutions. As a public university, it is heavily subsidized by the Yokohama municipal government, enabling it to offer high-quality education and cutting-edge research opportunities at tuition rates significantly lower than most private institutions, making it highly competitive both nationally and internationally.

### Strategic Location and Campus Life

YCU operates across several strategically located campuses, with the main administrative and academic center at the Kanazawa-Hakkei Campus. This campus is the hub for International Relations, Data Science, and the Arts and Sciences programs. The Fukura Campus houses the Medical School, offering a rigorous environment for life sciences and clinical training, while the Maioka Campus focuses on advanced research in immunology and regenerative medicine. The advantage of studying at YCU is the unparalleled access to the resources, culture, and economic opportunities of the greater Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area, without the overwhelming congestion and cost typically associated with studying directly in central Tokyo. Yokohama itself is a global hub, rich in international history, providing an ideal living laboratory for students in economics, international relations, and cultural studies.

### Core Mission and Research Excellence

YCU's mission is deeply rooted in contributing to the advancement of local society while cultivating a global perspective in its students. The university has made significant strides in specialized research fields, particularly in the life sciences, medical technology, and the increasingly crucial area of Data Science. The establishment of the Faculty of Data Science marked YCU as a pioneer in integrating statistical and computational methods across traditional academic disciplines, reflecting a commitment to adapting to the demands of the modern, data-driven world. Furthermore, its Advanced Medical Research Center is renowned for its breakthroughs in personalized medicine and fundamental biological research, attracting top scholars and offering state-of-the-art facilities.

## 🎓 Faculties & Departments

Yokohama City University is structured to provide focused, interdisciplinary education across a limited number of highly specialized faculties. For international undergraduate applicants, the primary point of entry is through the faculties that admit students based on the Japanese standard entrance system, typically requiring high performance on the Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU).

### 1. Faculty of International Relations

This faculty aims to nurture professionals capable of analyzing complex global issues from multiple perspectives, including political science, law, economics, and cultural studies. Given Yokohama’s role as a historic port city and international gateway, the curriculum emphasizes practical field research, linguistic competence, and cross-cultural communication skills essential for careers in international organizations, diplomacy, and global business.

### 2. Faculty of Data Science

Launched in 2018, this faculty is one of YCU's most innovative offerings. It focuses on the mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations necessary to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful insights. Unlike typical Computer Science programs, YCU’s Data Science faculty emphasizes the application of data science to solve real-world problems in economics, healthcare, and urban planning, preparing students for roles in high-tech industries and advanced research.

### 3. Faculty of Economics and Business Administration

Preparing students for leadership roles in commerce and finance, this faculty covers classical and modern economics, business management, marketing, and accounting. The curriculum is tailored to address the dynamics of the Japanese and global economies, leveraging Yokohama’s strong corporate presence for internship and networking opportunities.

### 4. School of Medicine

The School of Medicine, including both the Department of Medicine and the Department of Nursing, is highly selective and nationally recognized for its excellence in clinical training and biomedical research. The university's affiliated hospitals provide critical hands-on experience. Admission to the medical program is exceptionally competitive, even among domestic applicants, and requires near-native proficiency in Japanese.

### Graduate Education Focus

At the graduate level, YCU offers several specialized programs, including the Graduate School of International Management (MBA programs, some featuring English tracks) and the Graduate School of Medical Life Science. These postgraduate programs often provide more flexibility and specific English-taught course options, particularly in research-intensive fields like Medical Science and specific areas within Data Science.

## 🌍 International Student Support

YCU is committed to providing a supportive, welcoming environment for its relatively small, but highly valued, international student body. Support services are comprehensive, though proficiency in Japanese remains crucial for daily life and most academic pursuits.

### Admission Requirements and EJU

For nearly all undergraduate programs, the primary entrance method for non-Japanese citizens is the Special Admission for International Students, which mandates submission of scores from the **Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU)**. Required subjects typically include Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics (Course 2), and General Subjects (for humanities) or Science (for medicine/data science). Due to the highly rigorous coursework, YCU generally looks for top-tier EJU scores, often requiring Japanese language proficiency equivalent to or approaching the N1 level of the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test).

### English-Taught Programs (Degree Seeking)

YCU primarily operates under a Japanese medium of instruction. While certain graduate programs, particularly in specialized research fields or the International Management MBA, may offer coursework or research supervision entirely in English, degree-seeking undergraduate programs taught entirely in English are **extremely limited or non-existent**. Prospective international students must be prepared for rigorous Japanese language study.

### Scholarships and Financial Aid

As a public institution, YCU is already cost-effective, but it offers significant financial support to eligible international students:

1.  **Tuition Fee Waiver Program:** YCU maintains a robust fee reduction and exemption system for both the admission fee and the yearly tuition fee based on academic merit and financial need. Waivers can cover 50% or 100% of the tuition, making the cost comparable to, or even lower than, many home country universities.
2.  **YCU International Student Scholarship:** This is an institution-specific grant intended to support the living expenses of outstanding international students.
3.  **JASSO Scholarship:** Eligible students can apply for the Japanese Government Scholarship (Monbukagakusho, MEXT) or the JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) Scholarship for privately funded students, providing a monthly stipend.
4.  **Local and Private Grants:** YCU assists students in applying for various scholarships sponsored by the Yokohama municipal government and private foundations targeting international residents.

### Accommodation

YCU provides limited on-campus accommodation through its International Student House, offering affordable and convenient lodging. However, due to high demand, most international students transition to private housing within Yokohama after their first year. The university provides necessary guidance on securing apartments, understanding leasing procedures, and navigating the often complex Japanese guarantor system.

## 💰 Tuition & Fees

Studying at Yokohama City University is highly attractive due to the subsidized fee structure typical of public Japanese universities. The costs listed below are standard figures for self-funded undergraduate students as of the current academic year, pending yearly revisions. These fees are significantly lower than those found at major private institutions in the Kanto region.

| Fee Category | Amount (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admission Fee (Enrollment)** | ¥282,000 | Paid only once upon entrance. Waivers available. |
| **Yearly Tuition Fee** | ¥535,800 | Payable in two installments (Spring/Fall). Subject to fee waiver application. |
| **Total First Year Cost (Excl. Waivers)** | ¥817,800 | Approximately US $5,200 - $5,500 (depending on exchange rate). |

### Additional Financial Considerations

*   **Health Insurance:** Enrollment in the National Health Insurance (Kokumin Kenko Hoken) is mandatory, costing approximately ¥2,000–¥3,000 per month, providing coverage for 70% of medical costs.
*   **Miscellaneous Fees:** Campus accident insurance, student council fees, and departmental registration fees typically add ¥20,000–¥40,000 to the first-year costs.
*   **Living Expenses:** While Yokohama is less expensive than central Tokyo, the cost of living remains high. Monthly estimated expenses (rent, food, utilities, transportation) generally range from ¥100,000 to ¥150,000 depending on lifestyle and housing location. Public transportation within the Yokohama area is extensive but can be costly.
