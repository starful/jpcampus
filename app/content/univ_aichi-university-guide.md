## 🏫 University Overview & Reputation

Aichi University stands as a distinguished private institution, forming a core part of the higher education landscape in Japan’s economically vital Chubu region. Often categorized within the prestigious tier of private universities known locally as the 'Mei-Ai-Chuo-Jyo' group, Aichi University commands respect, particularly for its strength and depth in the social sciences, humanities, and international studies. It is not a National or Public university, but occupies a competitive and influential position among top private schools, offering high-quality education focused on developing globally-aware citizens and specialized professionals.

What truly sets Aichi University apart is its unique and foundational history. The university was established in 1946, immediately following the conclusion of World War II, but its roots trace back directly to the *Tōa Dōbun Shoin* (Shanghai East Asia Common Culture Academy), an influential Japanese academic institution operating in Shanghai before the war. This historical lineage imbues Aichi University with a powerful, long-standing focus on Asian affairs, international relations, and Chinese studies that is unparalleled by most universities in Japan. Its founding principles emphasize fostering international understanding, peace, and critical thinking—a mission directly stemming from its cross-cultural heritage. This dedication to international perspectives is a major draw for prospective international students.

Academically, Aichi University is highly regarded for its robust faculties in Law, Economics, and Business Administration, which consistently produce skilled graduates who are highly sought after by major corporations and regional governments across the Chubu area. Its modern, highly accessible Nagoya campus solidifies its role as an institution deeply integrated into the metropolitan environment, offering students direct exposure to industry and commerce. Its reputation is that of a solid, reliable, and forward-thinking university that places a premium on practical, globally-informed knowledge, positioning it firmly in the top tier of private regional universities in central Japan.


## 🎓 Faculties & Signature Programs

Aichi University boasts eight comprehensive faculties, primarily focused on the fields of social science and humanities. These faculties are distributed across its two main campuses: the highly urban and modern Nagoya Campus and the traditional, residential Toyohashi Campus, ensuring a diverse learning environment.

### Faculty Breakdown Table

### Signature Programs

#### 1. Faculty of Contemporary China Studies (現代中国学部)

This program is arguably Aichi University's most distinctive offering, deeply rooted in its historical connection to the Tōa Dōbun Shoin. The Faculty of Contemporary China Studies provides an extremely intensive and comprehensive understanding of modern China—covering its politics, economy, society, history, and language. Students benefit from faculty who are renowned experts in Chinese affairs and unparalleled access to resources related to the region. The curriculum requires rigorous Mandarin language training and encourages extensive study-abroad opportunities in mainland China or Taiwan. For international students, especially those interested in cross-border business, diplomacy, or academic research concerning East Asia, this faculty offers a crucial academic advantage and networking opportunities highly valued by employers in globalized industries.

#### 2. Faculty of International Communication (国際コミュニケーション学部)

Designed specifically to cultivate global leaders and mediators, the Faculty of International Communication is highly appealing to international students seeking a major focused on cross-cultural understanding and advanced linguistic skills. The program is divided into tracks emphasizing Global Studies, Media Studies, and Language Acquisition (English, Japanese, and others). While the full degree is primarily conducted in Japanese, this faculty integrates numerous modules taught in English, focusing on international media ethics, global marketing, and cultural analysis. It actively promotes high proficiency in English and often requires students to participate in specialized overseas exchange programs, making it an excellent bridge for students aiming for careers in international NGOs, tourism, global commerce, or foreign correspondence.


## 🌍 International Student Admissions & Life

### Admissions Process

For degree-seeking international students (privately financed), admission to Aichi University typically follows a specialized screening track separate from the general Japanese applicant pool. The general application cycle usually opens in the fall/winter for entry the following April, though specific faculties may have slightly different schedules.

1.  **Japanese Proficiency:** Demonstrating high Japanese proficiency is mandatory, as the vast majority of coursework is conducted in Japanese. This is primarily assessed via the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**. Applicants must achieve strong scores in the Japanese language section and usually in the subject sections (General Subjects for Humanities/Social Sciences). The required score thresholds are competitive for the top faculties like Law and Economics.
2.  **Academic Records & Application Documents:** Submission of certified academic transcripts, high school graduation certificates, personal essays detailing educational motivation, and financial guarantee documents.
3.  **English Proficiency Tests:** While not always required for general admission, strong scores in tests like **TOEFL iBT or IELTS** are highly recommended, particularly for applicants to the International Communication or Literature faculties, as they significantly bolster the application and indicate preparedness for globally focused studies.
4.  **Secondary Screening:** Successful document reviewers are typically required to attend an **Interview** (either in-person or online) and sometimes complete a **Faculty-Specific Examination** (e.g., an essay or small subject test). The interview is crucial, allowing the faculty to assess the student's motivation, Japanese communication ability, and cultural aptitude.

### English-Taught Programs

Aichi University does **not** currently offer comprehensive, four-year degree programs taught entirely in English (SGU programs) at the undergraduate level. As a highly-regarded private university focusing on regional and international social sciences, Aichi University requires strong proficiency in Japanese (EJU scores) for degree admission. 

However, Aichi University provides significant English-medium modules and specialized tracks within its faculties, particularly in:

*   **Faculty of International Communication:** Offers numerous specialized courses and seminars focusing on global issues, media, and marketing that are taught in English by native-speaking professors.
*   **Global Education Programs:** The university facilitates extensive short-term and long-term exchange programs globally, where students utilize English extensively. The emphasis is on bilingual (Japanese/English or Japanese/Chinese) competence rather than monolingual English instruction for the full degree.

### Student Support

The **Center for International Affairs (CIA)** is the primary hub for all international students. This office provides crucial support across several areas:

*   **Visa and Residency Status:** Comprehensive guidance and documentation support for visa renewal, permission to engage in activities outside the scope of status (part-time work), and initial entry procedures.
*   **Academic Advising:** Dedicated staff can help international students navigate academic registration, degree requirements, course selection (especially necessary Japanese language support courses), and connection with faculty mentors.
*   **Counseling Services:** Confidential mental health and academic counseling is available, with some services offered in English or other major languages.
*   **Housing Guidance:** While on-campus dormitories are limited, the CIA assists students in finding reputable and affordable off-campus apartments near the Nagoya or Toyohashi campuses, often collaborating with local real estate agencies familiar with international student needs.

### Campus Life & Diversity

Aichi University hosts a modest but thriving community of international students, numbering around 500-600 individuals, predominantly from East Asia (China, Korea, Taiwan) due to its historical focus, but increasingly attracting students from Southeast Asia and Western countries. The **Nagoya Campus** provides a vibrant, modern city life, integrated into the Sasashima Live redevelopment zone. Its highly contemporary setting facilitates excellent access to professional and cultural opportunities.

Student life is enriched by over 100 student clubs (circles) spanning sports (kendo, baseball, soccer), culture (tea ceremony, photography, manga), and academics. International students are highly encouraged to join these circles, which serve as the primary vehicle for cultural integration and developing friendships with Japanese students. The university regularly hosts cross-cultural events and orientation programs designed to ease the transition for newcomers, fostering a diverse yet cohesive campus atmosphere.


## 💰 Tuition, Scholarships & Cost of Living

Studying at Aichi University involves standard tuition fees typical of a high-tier private university in Japan, with minor variations depending on the faculty (science/engineering faculties, if they existed, would typically be higher, but Aichi is humanities/social science dominant).

### Detailed Cost Table (Average First Year)

| Item | Amount (JPY) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Admission Fee (Enrollment) | 250,000 |
| Yearly Tuition (Average) | 1,180,000 |
| Facility Fee | 180,000 |
| Other Association Fees | 30,000 |
| **Total First Year Cost Estimate** | **~1,640,000 JPY** |

*Note: Tuition fees are generally paid in two installments per year. The above figures are approximate average estimates for humanities/social science faculties and are subject to annual changes.*

### Scholarship Opportunities

Aichi University is supportive of international students and offers several pathways to reduce financial burdens:

1.  **Aichi University Foreign Student Scholarship (愛知大学外国人留学生奨学金):** This is the university's flagship internal scholarship. Eligible international students with excellent academic records can receive tuition reductions, often covering 30% to 50% of the annual tuition fee, sometimes renewable based on performance.
2.  **Aichi University Student Support Fund (AASF):** Offers stipends or grants to students facing unexpected financial difficulties or showing exceptional potential.
3.  **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship:** While securing MEXT directly through the university for undergraduate admission is competitive, students already enrolled may apply for internal selection slots for MEXT subsidies or transition to MEXT scholarships upon demonstrating superior academic achievement.
4.  **JASSO Scholarship:** The Japan Student Services Organization offers several non-repayable scholarships (such as the Honors Scholarship for Privately Financed International Students) providing monthly stipends (e.g., ¥48,000) based on financial need and academic merit. Aichi University assists students in applying for JASSO funds.
5.  **Private Foundation Scholarships:** Numerous external private foundations (e.g., Rotary, various regional industry funds) partner with Aichi University to offer monthly stipends, which staff can help international students apply for.

### Cost of Living

Aichi University’s main campus is located in Nagoya, Japan’s fourth-largest city. Nagoya offers a metropolitan experience comparable to Tokyo or Osaka but generally at a more affordable rate, particularly concerning housing.

*   **Rent:** A typical single-occupancy apartment (1K) near the city center or along major train lines costs between ¥45,000 and ¥65,000 per month. Suburbs near the Toyohashi campus are significantly cheaper.
*   **Food & Groceries:** Monthly food costs are manageable, usually around ¥30,000 to ¥45,000, benefiting from Nagoya’s regional specialization in cuisine (Nagoya-meshi).
*   **Transportation:** While the Nagoya campus is highly accessible (within walking distance of multiple stations), monthly transportation (train/bus) might cost ¥5,000 to ¥10,000, depending on the distance from residence.

**Estimated Monthly Budget (Excluding Tuition):** A realistic minimum budget for living in Nagoya as a student is approximately **¥90,000 to ¥130,000 JPY** per month.


## 📍 Campus Location & Access

### Main Campus Vibe

The main campus of Aichi University is the **Nagoya Campus**, strategically located in the Sasashima Live district, just southwest of the massive Nagoya Station complex.
