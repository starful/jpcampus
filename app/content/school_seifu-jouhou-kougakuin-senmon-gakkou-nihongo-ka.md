**2-Year Japanese Language Course:**

This comprehensive two-year course is designed for students with little to no prior knowledge of Japanese. The curriculum is structured to guide students from beginner to advanced levels, equipping them with the necessary language skills for academic and professional pursuits. The course emphasizes a balanced approach to language learning, covering all four skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Grammar and vocabulary are taught systematically, with ample opportunities for practice and reinforcement. A significant portion of the curriculum is dedicated to preparing students for the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students), including targeted practice exams and individualized feedback. In addition to academic preparation, the course also incorporates cultural activities and excursions to enhance students' understanding of Japanese society and customs. The teaching style is interactive and student-centered, encouraging active participation and collaboration. Instructors utilize a variety of teaching methods, including textbooks, multimedia resources, group projects, and role-playing exercises, to cater to different learning styles. Regular assessments and progress reports are provided to help students track their progress and identify areas for improvement.

**1.5-Year Japanese Language Course:**

The 1.5-year course is designed for students who want to acquire Japanese language skills in a shorter period. While the curriculum covers the same content as the 2-year course, it is delivered at a faster pace and requires a higher level of commitment from students. This course is ideal for those who have some prior exposure to Japanese or who are highly motivated and quick learners. The curriculum focuses on intensive grammar and vocabulary development, with a strong emphasis on practical communication skills. Students will learn how to engage in everyday conversations, express their opinions, and understand authentic Japanese materials. The course also provides comprehensive preparation for the EJU, ensuring that students are well-equipped to succeed in the exam. The teaching style is similar to the 2-year course, with a focus on interactive learning and student participation. However, the instructors may use more advanced materials and expect students to take greater responsibility for their own learning. The course also incorporates cultural activities and opportunities to interact with native Japanese speakers.

## Student Body & Campus Life

Based on the available data, the school has a capacity of 336 students but lacks reported specific data about the nationality mix of the international student population.
