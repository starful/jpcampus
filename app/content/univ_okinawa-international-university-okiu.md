## University Overview

Okinawa International University (OKIU), affectionately known as Okidai (沖国大), is a key institution of higher education located in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. Established in 1972, immediately after Okinawa's reversion to Japanese administration, OKIU has developed a distinct academic mission focused on liberal arts, regional development, and peace studies. Situated in Ginowan City, in the central part of Okinawa's main island, the university is close to important international and geopolitical sites, including the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. This location significantly influences the university’s research priorities and academic discussions.

## Core Philosophy and Identity

OKIU is founded on the principle of cultivating individuals who can contribute to the development of a peaceful and prosperous local community while actively participating in the international arena. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking, a comprehensive understanding of social structures, and practical engagement with Okinawan culture, history, and pressing contemporary issues, such as environmental sustainability, tourism economics, and the complexities of US-Japan security arrangements.

Unlike many large universities on mainland Japan, OKIU maintains a strong focus on undergraduate education and close interaction between students and faculty. Its research institutes, particularly the Institute of Okinawan History and Culture and the Okinawa Kokusai University Research Institute for Security and International Studies, serve as crucial centers for analyzing the unique challenges and opportunities facing the Ryukyu Islands.

For international students, OKIU offers a deeply immersive experience, not only into Japanese society but also into the rich, distinct, and historically complex Okinawan culture. While the primary language of instruction is Japanese, the international focus within specific faculties, especially International Studies, provides a stimulating environment for those interested in East Asian geopolitics, maritime security, and post-war history.

## Unique Institutional Environment

The university's proximity to major US military installations has historically shaped its identity, leading to a strong commitment to peace research and community activism. This context provides unparalleled opportunities for field research and engagement with real-world international issues directly on campus or in the surrounding community. Students have access to primary research materials regarding the US presence, land issues, and local governance, making it an excellent choice for those specializing in political science or international law.

## Faculties & Departments

Okinawa International University offers five core faculties, each designed to provide both specialized knowledge and a broad liberal arts foundation. The academic programs are carefully designed to link theoretical knowledge with the practical demands of the regional and global job market.

### 1. Faculty of Law (法学部)

This faculty aims to develop individuals with strong ethical standards and legal expertise who can contribute to building a just society. It covers traditional areas of Japanese law (Civil, Criminal, Constitutional) but uniquely emphasizes aspects of international law and administrative law pertinent to Okinawa’s political status and environmental protection.

*   **Department of Law:** Focuses on legal theory, judicial procedures, and specific regional applications of law, including US-Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) related issues.

### 2. Faculty of Economics (経済学部)

Focused on regional economic development, sustainable tourism, and international trade, the Faculty of Economics examines how global and national policies impact small island economies. The curriculum strongly emphasizes statistical analysis, policy planning, and the specific challenges of resource management in Okinawa.

*   **Department of Economics:** Offers specialties in theoretical economics, regional analysis, and economic history, often analyzing the transition from a post-war economy to a modern tourism and logistics hub.

### 3. Faculty of Business Administration (Commerce) (商学部)

This faculty prepares students for careers in management, finance, accounting, and marketing, with a specific lens focused on business practices in an island environment reliant on international connections and tourism. There is a robust focus on logistics and supply chain management relevant to Asia-Pacific trade.

*   **Department of Business Administration:** Core curriculum in corporate management, financial accounting, and organizational theory. Strong links with local businesses and entrepreneurial initiatives.

### 4. Faculty of International Studies (国際文化学部)

This faculty is perhaps the most compelling choice for international students, offering interdisciplinary approaches to understanding global issues, regional conflicts, and cultural exchange. Its proximity to diverse cultures (Japanese, Okinawan, American) makes it an exceptional environment for comparative study.

*   **Department of International Communication:** Focuses on global media, cross-cultural understanding, and the study of English and other foreign languages necessary for international careers.
*   **Department of Regional Development:** Analyzes social systems, urban planning, and policy-making aimed at improving quality of life and sustainable growth in island communities.

### 5. Faculty of Humanities (人文学部)

The Faculty of Humanities is dedicated to preserving and analyzing the unique cultural heritage of the Ryukyu Islands while fostering comprehensive human understanding. This faculty is essential for students interested in linguistics, history, philosophy, and peace studies.

*   **Department of Human Culture:** Covers Okinawan history, local languages (Uchināguchi), anthropology, archaeology, and the development of regional arts and philosophy.
*   **Department of Social Welfare:** Focuses on mental health, community social work, and policy related to supporting vulnerable populations within the unique socio-economic context of Okinawa.

## International Student Support

OKIU is committed to creating an environment where international students can thrive, although applicants must be prepared for a predominantly Japanese academic environment.

### 1. Admission Requirements and Language Proficiency

**Japanese Language Proficiency:** OKIU requires a very high level of Japanese proficiency for entry, as virtually all courses are conducted in Japanese. Prospective undergraduate students typically must demonstrate proficiency equivalent to **JLPT N2 (minimum)**, though **N1 is strongly recommended** for academic success in demanding fields like Law and Economics.

**Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU):** The EJU is mandatory for most undergraduate admissions. Required subjects typically include Japanese language, Mathematics (Course 1 or 2 depending on the faculty), and Japan and the World (for Humanities/Social Sciences).

**Application Cycle:** Applications generally open in the late fall (October/November) for enrollment the following April. International applicants usually apply through the special selection process for foreign students (私費外国人留学生入試).

### 2. Scholarships and Financial Aid

OKIU proactively helps international students manage the costs of studying abroad, utilizing both institutional and external funding sources:

*   **OKIU Special Scholarship for International Students:** This is the most common form of support, offering significant **tuition reduction (often 30% to 50%)** after the first year, contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. The initial year’s fee structure often requires full payment of the admission and tuition fees, with scholarships beginning in the second year.
*   **JASSO Scholarship:** OKIU assists students in applying for the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) Honors Scholarship, which provides a monthly stipend (currently around ¥48,000) for high-achieving, financially needy international students.
*   **Local Government and Private Foundation Scholarships:** Due to Okinawa's strong regional focus, many local non-profits and cultural organizations offer scholarships specifically targeting students studying Okinawan history, culture, and environmental science. The university’s International Exchange Office provides comprehensive lists and application assistance for these localized opportunities.

### 3. Housing and Student Life in Okinawa

While OKIU does not operate large, dedicated international student dormitories, it provides extensive assistance in securing local accommodations.

*   **Private Housing:** Most international students reside in private apartments or shared housing near the campus or along the bus routes in Ginowan or Urasoe. Rent in Okinawa is generally lower than in major metropolitan areas like Tokyo or Osaka, making the overall cost of living more manageable. Average monthly rent for a standard one-room apartment (1K) near campus ranges from ¥35,000 to ¥55,000.
*   **Homestay Programs:** For students seeking deeper cultural immersion, the university occasionally facilitates homestay opportunities, although these are limited.

**Cultural and Community Integration:** Studying in Okinawa provides a unique experience characterized by a relaxed pace of life, subtropical climate, and distinctive food culture. The university actively encourages participation in traditional Okinawan events, Eisa dancing groups, and community outreach programs, allowing international students to integrate beyond typical campus life.

## Tuition & Fees

The financial commitment required to attend Okinawa International University is generally moderate compared to premier private institutions on mainland Japan, but detailed financial planning is essential.

### Breakdown of Fees (Academic Year 2024 Estimates)

| Item | Amount (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admission Fee (Enrollment Fee)** | ¥220,000 | One-time payment upon initial enrollment. |
| **Yearly Tuition Fee** | ¥750,000 | Paid in two installments (Spring/Fall). |
| Facility & Equipment Fee | ¥120,000 | Annual fee for campus maintenance and infrastructure. |
| Other Association Fees (Student Union, etc.) | ¥30,000 | Required fees for student activities and insurance. |
| **Total First Year Cost (Approximate)** | **¥1,120,000** | Excludes living expenses and textbook costs. |
| **Total Subsequent Yearly Cost (Approximate)** | **¥900,000** | Excludes scholarship reductions. |

### Financial Planning and Cost Management

**Cost of Living Advantage:** The largest financial advantage of studying at OKIU is the lower cost of living in Okinawa compared to major mainland Japanese cities. Savings on housing, transportation (often relying on cycling or a local bus system rather than expensive city trains), and daily groceries can significantly reduce the overall annual budget.

**Payment Schedule:** Tuition is typically due semi-annually. International students must ensure they have sufficient funds available, especially for the first year, before eligibility for institutional scholarships is determined. Early application for external scholarships (like JASSO) is highly recommended to secure funding before arrival.

**Work Regulations:** International students on a Student Visa are legally permitted to work part-time up to 28 hours per week (or 40 hours during long university breaks), provided they obtain the necessary permission stamp (資格外活動許可) upon entry to Japan. The job market in Okinawa is primarily focused on tourism, retail, and local services, offering ample opportunities for supplemental income, though Japanese proficiency (N2 level or higher) is crucial for securing better-paying positions.
