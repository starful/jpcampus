| ------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 一般2年コース (General 2-Year Course) | 2 Years    | Beginner to Advanced    | Comprehensive Japanese language training covering all four skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking). Focus on grammar, vocabulary, and practical communication. Excellent preparation for university entrance. |
| 一般1.5年コース (General 1.5-Year Course) | 1.5 Years  | Beginner to Upper-Intermediate | Accelerated Japanese language training similar to the 2-year course, but with a faster pace. Suitable for students who want to quickly improve their Japanese skills. Preparation for EJU and university entrance. |

### 一般2年コース (General 2-Year Course)

The General 2-Year Course is the flagship program at Nara Gaigo Gakuin, designed for students with little to no prior knowledge of Japanese. The curriculum is structured to gradually build students' language proficiency from the absolute basics to an advanced level. In the first year, the focus is on mastering fundamental grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures. Students learn to engage in basic conversations, read simple texts, and write short paragraphs. The second year builds upon this foundation, introducing more complex grammar points, expanding vocabulary, and improving reading comprehension skills. Students learn to express themselves fluently and accurately in a variety of contexts, including academic and professional settings. The teaching style emphasizes interactive learning, with plenty of opportunities for students to practice their Japanese through role-playing, group discussions, and presentations. Teachers provide individualized feedback and support to help students overcome their weaknesses and achieve their full potential.

### 一般1.5年コース (General 1.5-Year Course)

The General 1.5-Year Course is an accelerated program designed for students who want to achieve fluency in Japanese in a shorter period of time. The curriculum covers the same content as the 2-year course, but at a faster pace. This course is suitable for students who have some prior knowledge of Japanese or who are highly motivated and dedicated to learning the language quickly. The teaching style is similar to the 2-year course, with a strong emphasis on interactive learning and practical application. However, students in the 1.5-year course are expected to be more independent and take more responsibility for their own learning. The program also places greater emphasis on test-taking strategies for the EJU and other standardized Japanese proficiency exams.

## 🌍 Student Body & Campus Life

Unfortunately, specific data regarding the current nationality mix at Nara Gaigo Gakuin is unavailable. However, given the school's location in a relatively less-touristed area of Japan compared to Tokyo or Osaka, it's reasonable to assume a potentially more diverse international student body, drawing students seeking a more authentic Japanese experience away from the large city hubs. It's also possible that the school attracts a significant number of students from Asian countries, particularly those with strong ties to Japanese culture and business.

While detailed information on campus facilities is limited, it's safe to assume that Nara Gaigo Gakuin provides standard amenities such as classrooms, a library or study area, and computer access for students.

Furthermore, given the school's commitment to university preparation, it's probable that the school has resources dedicated to academic counseling and EJU preparation.

Extracurricular activities are likely organized to enhance students' cultural understanding and provide opportunities for interaction with Japanese students and locals. These activities may include field trips to historical sites, participation in local festivals, and cultural workshops such as calligraphy, tea ceremony, or cooking classes. The school might also have clubs or groups focused on specific interests, such as anime, manga, or sports. These activities are designed to help students immerse themselves in Japanese culture, make friends, and develop a sense of community.
