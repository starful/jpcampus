## School Overview & Philosophy

Hiroshima Kokusai Business College (HKBC) is a Japanese language education institution under a vocational school located in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, one of Japan's major industrial and cultural centers. Unlike general private Japanese language schools, it has the characteristics of an educational institution called 'Senmon Gakko' (vocational school), providing students with in-depth educational opportunities linked to career and vocational training beyond simple language acquisition. Fukuyama City has the great advantage of lower prices and a more stable living environment compared to large cities such as Osaka or Tokyo, which creates favorable conditions for international students to concentrate on their studies and settle safely in the local community. The school has a capacity of 260 students, providing an intensive educational environment that allows for customized management for each student.

HKBC's educational philosophy focuses on fostering business professionals with an international perspective. As the school's name suggests, 'International (Kokusai)' and 'Business' are the core keywords of the education. Students are required to achieve high scores on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) and prepare for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU), while also taking practical business Japanese and etiquette education that can be immediately used in Japanese corporate culture and practical environments. This integrated approach provides a practical competitive advantage for students who wish to go on to graduate school, four-year universities, vocational schools, or find employment in Japanese companies after graduation.

The school has a very strong support system, especially for university preparation. In addition to EJU support items, it operates specialized educational tracks for students who wish to pursue the rare 'Science stream' and 'Art/Design' fields. This is a unique strength of HKBC that is difficult to find in general Japanese language schools that focus on humanities. Utilizing the geographical advantage of Fukuyama, the school has built a network with local industries and higher education institutions, providing students with various career exploration opportunities and specific university information. Thanks to this professional and systematic support, many international students are taking the next step in their successful study abroad experience in Japan through HKBC.

In conclusion, Hiroshima Kokusai Business College is the optimal choice for students seeking a systematic curriculum that minimizes tuition costs in a stable regional environment and considers professional advancement and vocational training beyond simple language learning. In particular, if you are aiming to enter a Japanese university in the future or build a career in the Japanese business environment, HKBC's specialized educational programs and career support system will be of great help. The school also offers 'dormitory' and 'single room' options, providing a stable solution to the housing problems that students may experience when first adapting to life in Japan, and creating an environment where they can concentrate solely on their studies. This is an important factor that reflects the school's high level of understanding and consideration for attracting and managing international students.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

HKBC operates mainly around university preparatory courses that are flexibly designed to suit the diverse enrollment times and career goals of students. The core is intensive education to achieve the 'university entrance' goal, and all courses are designed to equip students with a high level of Japanese proficiency equivalent to N1 during their studies. In particular, the curriculum integrates teaching methods that maximize 'business conversation' and 'practical conversation' skills, helping students communicate and adapt smoothly in actual Japanese society. HKBC's faculty has a wealth of experience and expertise in preparing for exams such as the EJU and JLPT, as well as in providing specialized guidance on actual university entrance interviews and essays.

**Key Courses and Features Analysis:**

| Course Name | Enrollment Period | Duration | Total Tuition (Reference) | Target Student Group and Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2-Year University Preparation Course | April | 24 months | 1,200,000 JPY | The most common course, starting from beginners and aiming to acquire N1 and high EJU scores with sufficient time. Intensive learning of basic science/humanities subjects in addition to Japanese. |
| 1.5-Year University Preparation Course | October | 18 months | 980,000 JPY | Mainly selected by students with N3 to N2 level in Korea. Efficient time management is essential, and the goal is to complete university preparation in a short period of time. |
| 1-Year University Preparation Course | April | 12 months | 660,000 JPY | Intensive course for students who already have a high level of Japanese proficiency (N2 or equivalent). Focuses on improving EJU scores and preparing customized interviews/essays for each university. |

The most notable part of HKBC's curriculum is its specialized university track. In addition to general humanities university preparation, dedicated supplementary classes and customized guidance are provided for students who wish to pursue higher education institutions related to 'Science' and 'Art/Design'. For science students, specialized guidance is provided on EJU science subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and for art/design students, portfolio preparation and practical guidance tailored to the trends of Japanese art university entrance exams are likely to be supported. These specialized programs broaden students' career choices and greatly increase their chances of success in their desired fields.

In addition, business Japanese education is strongly incorporated into the regular curriculum, as befits the school's name. Beyond simple rote memorization of grammar, students develop practical business communication skills, including honorific and humble language (敬語), email writing, and meeting etiquette used in actual Japanese companies. Classes are student-centered and focus on 'conversation' and 'discussion', maximizing Japanese language skills through active interaction. Teachers use the latest educational materials and multimedia to increase the interest and efficiency of classes, and meticulously manage students' academic progress through regular level tests and individual counseling.

**In-depth Curriculum Analysis and Teaching Methods:**

*   **EJU/JLPT Linked Intensive Learning:** In upper-level classes, EJU past paper analysis and mock exams are conducted regularly to fully prepare for the actual exam environment. JLPT preparation is provided in the form of separate supplementary classes, and all students strive to achieve at least N2, aiming for N1.
*   **Communication-Centered Conversation Education:** Not only daily conversation skills, but also academic discussion skills and presentation skills are intensively trained. These are essential skills for university entrance interviews and future business environments.
*   **Use of Various Learning Materials:** In addition to textbooks, the latest Japanese media such as newspapers, TV news, and current affairs magazines are used to learn living Japanese and Japanese culture, which plays a decisive role in improving listening and reading comprehension.

## Student Body & Campus Life

Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, where Hiroshima Kokusai Business College is located, offers an ideal environment for concentrating on studies because international student competition is less intense than in metropolitan areas and the cost of living is relatively low. The student body is expected to be mainly students from Asian countries (Korea, China, Vietnam, Nepal, etc.) with clear university goals. Thanks to the medium-sized school capacity (260 students), there is a strong bond between teachers and students, and a close-knit community is formed among students, where they can help each other and maintain academic motivation.

**Campus Life Support and Cultural Exchange:**

*   **Orientation and Settlement Support:** Through detailed orientation for new students, we provide guidance on Japanese life rules, administrative procedures (foreign registration, national health insurance enrollment, etc.), local information, and part-time job search methods to support initial settlement.
*   **Cultural Experience Activities:** In order to help students deeply understand Japanese culture, various cultural exchange events such as tea ceremony experience, kimono wearing, and participation in local festivals are held regularly. Exploring historical sites in Hiroshima and Fukuyama areas is of great help in understanding Japanese society.
*   **Local Community Engagement:** As a local vocational school, we provide international students with opportunities to participate in local community volunteer activities or cultural events through collaboration with Fukuyama City, thereby promoting interaction with real Japanese people and providing an environment for using practical Japanese.
*   **Psychological/Academic Counseling:** We provide professional counseling services for stress or academic underachievement that may be experienced during studying abroad, helping students maintain a stable psychological state and continue their studies. All faculty and staff are trained to understand and support the special needs of international students.

Thanks to this systematic support, HKBC students can not only achieve their academic goals, but also successfully build social life experiences in Japan. In addition to the cost savings, Fukuyama has a low crime rate and is safe, and the natural environment and urban convenience are harmoniously combined, guaranteeing a comfortable study abroad life.

## University & Career Pathways

HKBC is not just a Japanese language learning institution, but a vocational school that prioritizes students' advancement to higher education and employment. In particular, support for entering prestigious universities through the EJU is systematic, and the school has strengths in linking to vocational education institutions in Japan (especially in the fields of business, IT, and design) because it is a vocational school.

**Core Career Support System:**

*   **EJU Specialized Guidance:** Intensive education by specialized instructors is provided for each subject of the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) (Japanese, Comprehensive Subjects, Mathematics, and Science). In advanced classes, customized learning plans are established according to the target university and faculty, and practical skills are maximized through mock exams.
*   **Customized University Consulting:** 1:1 university counseling is conducted regularly from the beginning of the semester, taking into account individual academic achievement, interests, and budget. We provide close support throughout the entire process, from selecting supporting universities, guiding the preparation of supporting documents, and guiding interviews and essays for passing.
*   **Science/Art Design Specialized Support:** We actively provide in-depth learning of science subjects (physics, chemistry, biology) required for Japanese university entrance exams and portfolio preparation and practical guidance linkage programs for art university entrance exams. This means that professional entrance exam preparation is possible in the region without relying on large cram schools in Tokyo and Osaka.
*   **Linkage with Universities/Vocational Schools:** We provide students with opportunities to obtain the latest entrance exam information and meet directly with faculty from desired schools through regular entrance exam briefings and exchanges with universities and vocational schools in Fukuyama and the nearby Hiroshima area.
*   **Employment Support:** As it is a vocational school course, we provide students aiming for employment with education on Japanese employment market trends, resume (履歴書) writing, mock interviews, and business etiquette training. Utilizing HKBC's networking, it is also possible to provide local company internships or employment information.

**Scholarship System:**

HKBC operates various scholarship systems for international students who have excellent academic performance or need financial support. The main ones are:
*   **School Scholarship:** In-school scholarships are awarded to students with excellent grades, perfect attendance, and exemplary academic attitude.
*   **Japanese Government (MEXT) Learning Incentive:** The school actively supports students who meet certain requirements to be eligible to apply for learning incentives paid by the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO).
*   **JLPT/EJU Excellent Performance Scholarship:** Awards are given to students who have achieved high scores to motivate them to study.

## Accommodation & Living Support

For international students, housing is one of the biggest hurdles for initial settlement. HKBC deeply understands this point and offers 'dormitory' options through direct management or partnerships, and the option of 'single room' is a major advantage.

**Main Accommodation and Living Support Features:**

*   **School Dormitory:** Dormitories located near the school provide the optimal environment for saving commute time and living safely. Dormitories are generally equipped with basic living furniture such as beds, desks, air conditioners, and heating facilities, allowing students to start living immediately without additional initial investment.
*   **Single Room Provided:** Unlike many school dormitories in Japan that provide double rooms as standard, HKBC offers single room options to protect individual privacy and focus on studies. This is a very advantageous condition for students who need intensive EJU preparation or self-directed learning.
*   **Dormitory Costs and Structure:** Dormitory costs can be set between 30,000 JPY and 50,000 JPY per month, which is significantly lower than the initial cost burden compared to the general studio apartment rent (including deposit and key money) in the Fukuyama area. It also provides a community experience where you can interact with other students through common facilities (kitchen, laundry).
*   **Life Support:** The school provides administrative support necessary for all aspects of life in Japan, including opening bank accounts, opening mobile phones, and guidance on using hospitals, in addition to housing problems. In particular, the help of school staff is essential in the initial stages when Japanese is not proficient.
*   **Part-time Job Guidance:** Fukuyama area is not as competitive as large cities, so you can find part-time jobs relatively stably. The school actively supports students to legally work part-time within the scope that does not interfere with their studies by providing information and interview guidance.

A stable living environment and systematic living support provide a foundation for international students to focus solely on their studies without stress. Single room dormitories are a key factor in completing this study concentration environment.

## Tuition, Fees & Scholarships

Tuition fees at Hiroshima Kokusai Business College reflect the geographical advantage of Fukuyama and are set at a competitive level compared to schools located in large cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. In particular, the total tuition fee for the 1-year university preparation course (660,000 JPY) is exceptionally low, which is interpreted as a reflection of the school's intention to minimize the financial burden on students. However, since this cost may not include enrollment fees and facility maintenance fees, it is essential to check the detailed breakdown when finally registering.

**Detailed Financial Support and Scholarship Benefits:**

HKBC provides various scholarship opportunities so that international students can continue their studies without financial difficulties. Scholarships are mainly awarded based on academic performance, attendance rate, and achievement of university goals.

*   **Pre-enrollment Scholarship:** There may be a system that reduces a portion of the enrollment fee at the time of enrollment for those who have JLPT N2 or higher or have a high score in the EJU Japanese language area.
*   **Scholarship for Excellent Academic Performance:** Awarded to top students through grade evaluation at the end of each semester. It plays a role in motivating students and increasing competitiveness. Due to the educational course linkage characteristics of HKBC's vocational school, EJU comprehensive subject scores or Business Japanese Proficiency Test (BJT) scores may be reflected in the evaluation in addition to Japanese language scores.
*   **Scholarship for Excellent Attendance:** Awarded to students with perfect attendance to encourage attendance rate (90% or higher), which is an essential factor for maintaining a Japanese international student visa. This is an indicator of how important the school places on students' sincerity.
*   **JASSO Learning Incentive Support:** The school actively guides and recommends students who can receive a monthly fixed amount (approximately 48,000 JPY) through the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO). This is the most financially helpful scholarship, and generally, students with very excellent academic performance and attendance rate are given the recommendation qualification.

By providing affordable tuition fees and abundant scholarship opportunities, HKBC presents a practical alternative to students who are hesitant to study abroad for financial reasons. When combined with the low cost of living in Fukuyama, HKBC can be evaluated as one of the most cost-effective educational institutions for studying in Japan. All students should consult with the school in detail about scholarship application eligibility and procedures after enrollment. This thorough tuition fee management and financial support system is an important strength of HKBC that allows students to focus on achieving their university goals without financial worries. In particular, the fact that it maintains reasonable costs while supporting various specialized courses (science, art/design) is a key factor in enhancing the educational competitiveness of this school.
