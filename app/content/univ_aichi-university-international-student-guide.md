## 🏫 University Overview

Aichi University (愛知大学) stands as a prominent private institution in Japan's central Chūbu region, offering a robust curriculum primarily focused on the humanities, social sciences, and regional policy. Founded in 1946, the university traces its roots to the former East Asia Institute (東亜同文書院) located in Shanghai, which lends it a uniquely strong institutional focus on East Asian studies, particularly contemporary China. This historical lineage is a significant feature that distinguishes Aichi University on the national academic landscape.

Aichi University operates on a dual-campus system, providing students with contrasting yet complementary learning environments. The primary, newer hub is the **Nagoya Campus**, strategically located near Nagoya Station, making it highly accessible and situated within a bustling urban center. This campus is the base for faculties such as Law, Economics, Business Administration, International Communication, and Contemporary China Studies. Its modern infrastructure caters to students seeking a dynamic, metropolitan university experience.

Conversely, the **Toyohashi Campus**, located in eastern Aichi Prefecture, offers a more traditional and serene environment, housing the Faculties of Literature, Regional Policy, and Education. This campus benefits from extensive grounds, comprehensive athletic facilities, and a deep-rooted history, often serving as the residential campus for incoming international students, fostering a strong sense of community and academic focus.

For international students, Aichi University represents an excellent opportunity to pursue high-quality education outside the hyper-competitive Tokyo/Kansai areas while benefiting from the economic vibrancy of the Aichi Prefecture, home to global manufacturing giants. The university is dedicated to producing graduates with broad perspectives, adaptability, and a strong understanding of global and regional dynamics, making it an ideal choice for those interested in bridging cultures and economies.


## 🎓 Faculties & Departments

Aichi University is structured across eight undergraduate faculties, each offering specialized programs designed to cultivate expertise in critical fields. The curricula emphasize practical application, rigorous research methodology, and international awareness, ensuring graduates are well-prepared for diverse career paths in Japan and globally.

**2. Faculty of Economics (経済学部):** Focused on theoretical and applied economics, the curriculum includes macroeconomics, microeconomics, and specialized areas such as industrial organization and environmental economics. International students often find the focus on Japanese economic policy and East Asian economic integration highly relevant.

The faculty promotes entrepreneurial spirit and utilizes case studies relevant to Japanese corporations and international markets. It is tailored to produce skilled business leaders capable of navigating complex global operations.

**4. Faculty of Contemporary China Studies (現代中国学部):** This is Aichi University’s flagship and most distinctive faculty, building directly upon its historical roots. It offers an unparalleled, multidisciplinary approach to understanding modern China, covering its language, politics, society, history, and rapidly evolving economy. Students often participate in required long-term study abroad programs in China, making it an exceptional pathway for deep cross-cultural expertise.

**5. Faculty of International Communication (国際コミュニケーション学部):** Dedicated to cultivating global communicators. This faculty includes specialized tracks in English communication, Japanese language education (for those who wish to teach Japanese), and cross-cultural studies, essential for careers in international relations, media, and diplomacy.

**6. Faculty of Literature (文学部):** Based at the Toyohashi Campus, this faculty offers deep dives into history (Japanese and global), philosophy, geography, and various linguistic studies. It preserves the humanities tradition, encouraging critical thinking, detailed textual analysis, and profound understanding of human civilization and culture.

**7. Faculty of Regional Policy (地域政策学部):** This unique faculty focuses on governance, urban planning, environmental issues, and sustainable development within a regional context.

It's excellent for students interested in public administration or non-profit work.

Faculty of Education (教育学部):** Established to train future educators, this faculty offers programs in primary and secondary education, focusing on pedagogical methods, child psychology, and curriculum development. It is crucial for international students seeking qualifications to teach in Japanese schools or international educational settings.


## 🌍 International Student Support

Aichi University places significant emphasis on providing robust support systems for its diverse international student body, recognizing the unique challenges faced when adapting to a new country and academic environment. 

### Language and Academic Support

The university provides specialized Japanese Language Program (JLP) courses tailored to the needs of international students, aiming to rapidly improve academic Japanese skills necessary for coursework and daily life. Remedial classes are also available for specific subjects where language proficiency might initially impede understanding. Furthermore, the Academic Advising Center offers one-on-one guidance on study techniques, assignment submission, and cultural adaptation.

### Housing and Accommodation

While housing is competitive, Aichi University offers designated **International Student Dormitories**, particularly on the Toyohashi Campus, providing a cost-effective and socially integrated start to university life. These dorms are generally available for the first year of study, offering single rooms and shared facilities, facilitating integration with local and other international students. The International Center also assists students in searching for private apartments near the Nagoya Campus once they transition out of university housing, leveraging partnerships with local real estate agencies familiar with international student tenancy requirements.

### Scholarships and Financial Aid

Aichi University offers a highly attractive array of institutional scholarships specifically targeting privately funded international students (私費外国人留学生). These scholarships significantly alleviate the financial burden:

*   **Aichi University International Student Scholarship:** A primary source of aid, often providing substantial tuition reductions or monthly stipends based on academic merit and financial need.
*   **Reduction/Exemption of Tuition Fees:** High-performing students are eligible for potential reductions in their annual tuition fees, sometimes covering 30% to 50% of the cost.
*   **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship:** Although competitive, the university actively nominates outstanding candidates for the Japanese government's MEXT scholarship, which covers tuition and provides a generous monthly stipend.
*   **External Private Scholarships:** The International Center regularly circulates information and assists students in applying for various external scholarships provided by foundations and local organizations specific to the Aichi region.

### Daily Life and Career Support

The International Center acts as the primary liaison for all non-academic issues, assisting with essential procedures such as visa renewal, national health insurance enrollment, and banking. Crucially, the Career Center runs specialized workshops and counseling sessions for international students, helping them navigate the complex job-hunting landscape in Japan (Shūshoku Katsudō), focusing on résumé building, interview practice, and understanding recruitment timelines.


## 💰 Tuition & Fees

Studying at Aichi University, while being a private institution, offers a generally moderate cost structure compared to the top private universities in Tokyo, representing excellent value, especially when factoring in the available scholarship opportunities. The fees outlined below are typical estimates for undergraduate enrollment and may vary slightly depending on the specific faculty (e.g., Literature vs. Law).

### Initial Enrollment Costs (First Year)

Upon acceptance, international students must pay an initial sum which generally covers the Admission Fee (Enrollment Fee) and the first semester's tuition and facility fees.

| Item | Cost (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admission Fee** (Enrollment Fee) | ¥250,000 | Paid only upon initial enrollment. |
| **First Semester Tuition** | Approx. ¥575,000 | Half of the annual tuition. |
| **Facility Fee & Others** | Approx. ¥120,000 | Covers facility maintenance, educational resources, etc. |
| **Total Initial Payment** | Approx. ¥945,000 | Requires payment before the start of the first term. |

### Subsequent Annual Costs

After the first year, students are generally required to pay the annual tuition and facility fees, typically split across two semesters (Spring and Fall).

| Item | Cost (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yearly Tuition Fee** | ¥1,150,000 | Standard undergraduate fee (varies slightly by faculty). |
| **Yearly Facility Fee** | ¥240,000 | Includes necessary maintenance and operational costs. |
| **Total Yearly Cost (Year 2+)** | **¥1,390,000** | Equivalent to approximately $9,000 USD (subject to exchange rate). |

### Financial Strategy for International Students

It is imperative for prospective students to apply for institutional scholarships simultaneously with their admission application. A successful scholarship application, even a partial tuition waiver, can reduce the effective annual cost significantly, often placing the net cost of attendance in line with or below the fees charged by many national universities. Given the competitive nature of the Japanese job market, the career focus and specialized knowledge gained, particularly in China Studies and Regional Policy, offer a strong return on investment. Students should also budget an additional ¥600,000 to ¥1,000,000 annually for living expenses (rent, food, utilities), depending heavily on whether they reside in subsidized dormitories or private accommodations in Nagoya.
