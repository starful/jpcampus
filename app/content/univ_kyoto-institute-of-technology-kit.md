*   **Key Research Fields:** Functional materials (e.g., smart textiles, shape-memory polymers), inorganic materials, and materials processing engineering.

#### 3. Department of Applied Biology

*   **Focus Areas:** The application of biological principles to solve engineering and environmental problems. This department blends genetics, biochemistry, and environmental science.
*   **Key Research Fields:** Bio-resource utilization, environmental biotechnology, molecular biology, and functional food science.

### II. School of Design and Architecture (Kyoto Design School)

This school is dedicated to integrating aesthetic quality, human factors, and technical feasibility in creating built environments and industrial products. It fosters critical thinking about the societal impact of design.

#### 1. Department of Design and Architecture

*   **Focus Areas:** Architectural planning, urban design, industrial design, textile design, and communication design. The curriculum focuses heavily on studio work, historical context, and practical application.
*   **Key Research Fields:** Sustainable architecture, history of architecture (especially Japanese traditional styles), universal design, and human-computer interaction (HCI) in design.

#### 2. Department of Information Science

*   **Focus Areas:** While technically housed under the School of Science and Technology in some contexts, Information Science often works closely with Design and Architecture, focusing on the computational aspects of design, modeling, and data management.
*   **Key Research Fields:** Computer graphics, artificial intelligence (AI) applications in engineering and design, network technology, and computational science.

### Graduate Level Programs

KIT is highly research-intensive, with a vast majority of students continuing to the Master’s and Doctoral levels. The Graduate School of Science and Technology offers specialized tracks, including several English-taught tracks for international researchers, such as the International Doctoral Program in Environmental and Materials Science, aiming to attract top-tier global talent.

## 🌍 International Student Support

KIT is committed to fostering a diverse environment and provides robust support systems tailored for international students, covering academic life, daily living, and financial aid.

### 1. Admissions Requirements (Undergraduate)

For most undergraduate programs, high proficiency in Japanese and performance in the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) are mandatory.

*   **Japanese Language:** Generally, N1 level of the JLPT or an equivalent high score on the EJU Japanese section is required due to the specialized nature of the lectures.
*   **EJU Subjects:** Applicants typically need scores in Japanese, Science (Physics, Chemistry), and Mathematics (Course 2, the advanced track).
*   **Secondary Screening:** Successful EJU applicants proceed to an individualized secondary examination, usually involving an essay, interview, and/or specialized subject tests conducted on the KIT campus. Admissions are highly competitive due to KIT's specialized national status and the limited number of seats.

### 2. Scholarships and Financial Aid

KIT actively assists international students in securing necessary financial aid, often through the following key avenues:

*   **MEXT Scholarship (Japanese Government Scholarship):** Priority admission is often given to students who successfully secure the MEXT scholarship (via embassy recommendation or university recommendation). This covers tuition, fees, and provides a generous monthly stipend.
*   **Tuition Waiver Program:** As a national university, KIT offers extensive tuition exemption programs (減免, *genmen*). Students demonstrating exceptional academic merit or financial need may apply for a full (100%) or partial (50%) waiver of the entrance and/or yearly tuition fees. International students are highly encouraged to apply, though the process is rigorous and competitive.
*   **JASSO Scholarships:** Students can apply for the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) Honors Scholarship, which provides a monthly stipend for privately funded international students showing good academic standing.
*   **Private and Local Scholarships:** KIT has connections with numerous private foundations (e.g., Rotary, various industrial foundations) that offer specific scholarships tailored to students studying specialized fields like engineering or materials science.

### 3. Housing and Living Support

Kyoto is a highly desirable place to live, meaning housing can be competitive. KIT offers dedicated support to secure affordable accommodations:
