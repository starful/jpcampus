## 🏫 School Overview & Philosophy

TCC Japanese Language School, nestled in the bustling yet charming Nakano district of Tokyo, offers a focused and rigorous academic environment specifically tailored for international students aiming to pursue higher education in Japan. Located at 5-28-4 Arai, Nakano-ku, the school benefits from being in a vibrant area known for its mix of modern convenience and traditional Japanese culture. Nakano Broadway, a renowned shopping complex filled with anime, manga, and retro goods, is a major draw, while easy access to Shinjuku and other central Tokyo locations makes it an ideal base for exploring the city.

TCC's educational philosophy centers around providing comprehensive and specialized instruction in Japanese language and academic subjects to ensure students' success in Japanese university entrance examinations. Unlike language schools with broader focuses, TCC uniquely concentrates solely on "Shingaku" (university preparation) courses. This singular focus allows the school to meticulously design its curriculum and teaching methodologies to address the specific needs and challenges faced by students striving to enter Japanese universities, graduate schools, and vocational colleges. The school's capacity is 222 students, fostering a close-knit community where personalized attention can be effectively provided.

The school's commitment extends beyond simply teaching the Japanese language. TCC recognizes the importance of cultural understanding and adaptation for international students. The curriculum incorporates elements that help students navigate Japanese society, understand academic expectations, and integrate smoothly into university life. With experienced instructors and a supportive staff, TCC strives to create a nurturing yet challenging environment where students can confidently develop the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve their academic goals in Japan.

With a legacy built on a solid foundation of preparing students for academic success, TCC constantly adapts its curriculum and teaching methods to reflect the evolving demands of the Japanese higher education landscape. The school places significant emphasis on providing students with the resources and support they need to excel in the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) and other relevant entrance exams. The overall aim is to empower students to not only gain admission to their desired universities but also thrive in their chosen fields of study.

**University Preparatory Course (2 Years):** This course is designed for students with little to no prior knowledge of Japanese. Over two years, students will build a strong foundation in all aspects of the language, from basic grammar and vocabulary to advanced reading and writing skills. A significant portion of the curriculum is dedicated to preparing students for the EJU. This includes intensive practice in Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics (both Course 1 and Course 2), Science (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology), and Japan and the World. Furthermore, the course provides comprehensive guidance on writing personal statements, preparing for university interviews, and completing the application process. Teaching style emphasizes a balanced approach, combining classroom instruction with practical exercises, group projects, and individual tutoring. Cultural activities are also integrated into the curriculum to provide students with a deeper understanding of Japanese society and culture.

**University Preparatory Course (1 Year 9 Months):** This accelerated course is designed for students who already possess some basic Japanese language skills. The curriculum covers the same content as the two-year course but at a faster pace. The emphasis is on intensive EJU preparation, with a particular focus on improving students' scores in Japanese as a Foreign Language and their chosen science subjects (for those pursuing STEM fields). The teaching style is highly interactive, encouraging students to actively participate in class discussions and practice their language skills through role-playing and presentations. Regular mock exams are conducted to assess students' progress and identify areas where they need additional support.

**University Preparatory Course (1.5 Years):** Similar to the 1 Year 9 Months course, this program provides a compressed curriculum for those with existing basic Japanese. The focus is on bridging the gap between the student’s current level and that needed to succeed in the EJU. A key element involves subject-specific classes tailored to the EJU. Teaching emphasizes efficiency and targeted learning with teachers focusing on areas where EJU scores can be most effectively improved in the shortest time.

**University Preparatory Course (1 Year 3 Months):** This is the most intensive course offered by TCC, designed for students who have a solid foundation in Japanese and are highly motivated to enter university as quickly as possible. The curriculum is extremely demanding, requiring students to dedicate significant time and effort to their studies. The teaching style is highly structured, with a strong emphasis on independent learning and self-study. Students are expected to take responsibility for their own progress and seek assistance from instructors when needed. This course is ideal for students who are already familiar with the EJU format and content and are looking to refine their skills and maximize their scores.

## 🌍 Student Body & Campus Life
