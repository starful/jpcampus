## School Overview & Philosophy

TCC Japanese Language School, situated in the vibrant Nakano district of Tokyo, provides a focused academic environment specifically designed for international students seeking higher education in Japan. Located at 5-28-4 Arai, Nakano-ku, the school is in a lively area known for its blend of modern convenience and traditional Japanese culture. Nakano Broadway, a famous shopping complex with anime, manga, and retro goods, is a significant attraction, while easy access to Shinjuku and other central Tokyo areas makes it an ideal base for exploring the city.

TCC's educational philosophy is centered on delivering comprehensive and specialized instruction in Japanese language and academic subjects to ensure students' success in Japanese university entrance examinations. Unlike language schools with broader focuses, TCC uniquely concentrates solely on "Shingaku" (university preparation) courses. This specific focus allows the school to meticulously design its curriculum and teaching methodologies to address the particular needs and challenges faced by students striving to enter Japanese universities, graduate schools, and vocational colleges. With a capacity of 222 students, TCC fosters a close-knit community where personalized attention can be effectively provided.

The school's commitment goes beyond simply teaching the Japanese language. TCC understands the importance of cultural understanding and adaptation for international students. The curriculum includes elements that help students navigate Japanese society, understand academic expectations, and integrate smoothly into university life. With experienced instructors and a supportive staff, TCC strives to create a nurturing yet challenging environment where students can confidently develop the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve their academic goals in Japan.

Built on a strong foundation of preparing students for academic success, TCC constantly adapts its curriculum and teaching methods to reflect the evolving demands of Japanese higher education. The school places significant emphasis on providing students with the resources and support they need to excel in the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) and other relevant entrance exams. The overall aim is to empower students to not only gain admission to their desired universities but also thrive in their chosen fields of study.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

TCC exclusively offers University Preparatory Courses (Shingaku), ranging from 1 year and 3 months to 2 years. These courses are designed to take students from beginner Japanese proficiency (N5) to advanced levels (N1+) while providing intensive subject-specific preparation for the EJU.
