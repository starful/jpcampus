## School Overview & Philosophy

Kozan Gakuin Japanese Language School, situated in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, the central metropolis of Japan, is dedicated to nurturing international talent and ensuring the successful advancement of its students to their desired higher education institutions in Japan. Nagoya boasts relatively stable living costs compared to Tokyo or Osaka, yet it's a vibrant city concentrating Japan's leading industries (automobiles, aerospace, etc.) and cutting-edge technology. This provides an optimal environment for international students to concentrate on their studies while exploring a wide range of cultural experiences and future employment opportunities.

As a relatively small school with a capacity of 168 students, the faculty and staff prioritize closely monitoring each student's academic progress and career goals, providing tailored education accordingly. The school's educational goal extends beyond merely achieving high scores on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). It aims to equip students with advanced academic Japanese language skills, critical thinking abilities, and professional communication skills required in Japanese universities or graduate schools. A distinctive feature of Kozan Gakuin is its specialized, customized curriculum for students aspiring to advance in specific fields such as science, art, and business, offering an in-depth learning environment not typically found in general Japanese language schools.

The school is conveniently located in the Sakae area, the heart of Nagoya, offering easy access to various cultural facilities and learning environments. This geographical advantage is crucial in helping students quickly adapt to life in Japan and concentrate on their studies.

Kozan Gakuin supports students in maximizing their potential, demonstrating clear results, particularly in preparation for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU). Setting the ultimate vision of the school as going beyond simple language acquisition, to deeply understand Japanese society and culture, and to build a foundation for growing into global talent. Students receive individual career counseling from the time of enrollment, designing a learning roadmap tailored to their desired university and major. This systematic management system is the secret to minimizing student dropout and maintaining a high rate of advancement. Furthermore, the school directly operates dormitory facilities to resolve initial settlement issues that international students may experience, and provides a 'single room' option, demonstrating careful consideration so that students can comfortably focus on their studies in a private space. Kozan Gakuin has established itself as the most reliable partner for students in the Nagoya area who wish to simultaneously pursue advancement and specialized education. The school's multifaceted support system will be critical in helping international students design a successful future in Japan. Regular mock exams to improve students' academic performance, as well as supplementary classes and after-school learning programs specializing in the EJU and JLPT are actively conducted. The school also flexibly provides short-term course options to meet the diverse needs of international students, reflecting its efforts to provide a wide range of learning opportunities.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at Kozan Gakuin Japanese Language School is clearly designed with a focus on 'advancement' to higher education. Long-term courses are divided into A, B, C, and D courses depending on the enrollment period, and all courses are ultimately optimized for students aiming to enter prestigious Japanese universities, vocational schools, or graduate schools. The curriculum starts with the basic acquisition of Japanese and then focuses on intensive learning of essential vocabulary and grammar required for EJU subjects (Comprehensive Subjects, Mathematics, and Science) and JLPT N1 preparation in the intermediate stage. The advanced stage focuses on cultivating university-level academic presentations, thesis writing, and discussion skills, thereby preparing students to quickly adapt to actual university lecture environments.

### Specialized Advancement Tracks

Kozan Gakuin's greatest strength is the separate operation of science, art/design, and business tracks in addition to general advancement classes. These tracks are designed not only to learn Japanese but also to acquire specialized knowledge in the relevant fields in Japanese and to prepare for specialized subjects required for the entrance examination.

*   **Science Track:** Offers specialized classes in EJU science subjects such as mathematics (Course 2), physics, and chemistry for students aiming to enter science and engineering universities. It helps students secure competitive scores by maximizing the synergy between learning Japanese and specialized subjects.
*   **Art/Design Track:** Cultivates the ability to prepare portfolios (practical skills) for students wishing to enter art universities, as well as essential Japanese interviews and essay writing skills for art university entrance exams. It enhances the learning effect by linking with the rich design and art infrastructure in the Nagoya area.
*   **Business Track:** Offers in-depth learning of practical business Japanese, such as business manners, the use of honorifics, and presentation skills, for students aiming to enter business-related fields or find employment in Japan.

### EJU Intensive Preparation and Teaching Methods

The school has a team of professional instructors with extensive experience in the EJU exam, and analyzes students' weaknesses through regular mock exams and provides individualized feedback. The class method avoids one-way lectures and focuses on improving practical communication skills by actively introducing student-centered conversation and discussion classes. In particular, special intensive sessions are held to strengthen 'conversation' skills, helping students to use Japanese with confidence even in situations outside of academics. In addition to the advancement courses, short-term course options are also offered, providing flexible learning opportunities for students who want to use their vacation periods or aim to experience Japanese culture.

## Student Body & Campus Life

Kozan Gakuin leverages the advantages of Nagoya as an international city to create an environment where students of various nationalities, mainly from Asia, study together. Nagoya is the next economic center after Tokyo and Osaka, and is popular with international students of various nationalities due to its abundant employment and advancement opportunities. The school holds regular cultural experience activities and school events to encourage students to respect and interact with different cultures and broaden their perspectives.

**Advantages of Nagoya:** Students can live a stable study abroad life with lower living expenses than in crowded big cities, and can easily access historical and cultural attractions such as Nagoya Castle and Osu Shopping Street. In addition, the Sakae area where the school is located is a commercial and entertainment center, so there are relatively abundant part-time job opportunities. The school facilities are modern and well-maintained so that students can study comfortably, and are equipped with study rooms, a library, and a computer room to support students in concentrating on their studies even after school.

**Student Support and Cultural Exchange:** The school helps students use Japanese in real life and deeply integrate into Japanese culture through 'buddy programs' with Japanese students and exchange events with local residents. Counseling services are also regularly provided to help international students manage stress and resolve academic concerns, so that students can study with psychological stability. In particular, in order to increase the concentration of students aiming to advance to higher education, a self-study atmosphere is created and a senior mentoring program is operated to share the experience of passing the target university, providing practical help.

## University & Career Pathways

The advancement support system at Kozan Gakuin is very systematic and reflects the individual characteristics of students. As a specialized school for higher education advancement, its goal is to perfectly prepare students for all the elements required for Japanese university entrance exams, as well as acquiring high scores on the EJU and JLPT.

*   **EJU/JLPT Specialized Education:** In addition to regular classes, EJU mock exams and advanced problem-solving classes are offered, and dedicated teachers are assigned to prepare for science (mathematics, science subjects) and humanities (comprehensive subjects). Students receive customized learning plans to reduce the gap between their current skills and target scores.
*   **University Interview and Essay Guidance:** Provides intensive training for interviews and essays (小論文), which are one of the most important elements in Japanese university entrance exams. Students relieve tension and gain confidence through mock interviews similar to actual interview situations, and receive intensive guidance to develop logical thinking and expression skills.
*   **Specialized Field Advancement Counseling:** Provides information on universities and vocational schools in the relevant fields to students in the science and art/design tracks, and provides specialized consulting such as advice on portfolio preparation and arrangements to meet with professors majoring in the relevant fields. This is differentiated support that is difficult to receive at a general language school. In particular, the range of advancement options for students is expanded through links with excellent engineering and art universities in the Nagoya area.
*   **Wide Range of Advancement Results:** Kozan Gakuin has been consistently sending students to various prestigious private and national/public universities in Nagoya, Kanto, and Kansai areas, including Nagoya University, Aichi University, and Meijo University, and the successful advancement cases of students demonstrate the school's strong competitiveness. It continues to focus on improving academic Japanese language skills so that students can continue to succeed in their studies even after advancing to higher education.

## Accommodation & Living Support

A stable initial settlement for international students is the key to a successful study abroad life. Kozan Gakuin Japanese Language School provides directly managed dormitory facilities for the convenience and safety of students. In particular, one of the biggest residential welfare benefits provided by the school is the provision of **'single room'** options.

**Advantages of Single Room Dormitories:** Unlike most language school dormitories that basically provide rooms for two or more people, Kozan Gakuin offers single rooms as the main option so that students can concentrate on their studies and get enough rest in an independent space. This is a very ideal environment for students preparing for higher education advancement who are under high academic stress. The dormitories are conveniently located for commuting to school and are fully equipped with basic living furniture (beds, desks, air conditioners, storage, etc.) and facilities (shared kitchen, laundry room) so that students can start living immediately after entering the country.

**Living Support and Safety Management:** The school strictly manages the dormitory life rules to maintain a safe and orderly living environment. In addition, it provides comprehensive living support services in Korean and other languages, such as administrative procedures (registration at the ward office, opening bank accounts, etc.), guidance on using medical institutions, and finding part-time jobs, for international students who are not familiar with Japanese life. It provides living tips and emergency contact networks in Nagoya City to ensure that students can ask for help at any time. Student safety is our top priority, and we also operate a 24-hour emergency contact system that can respond quickly in the event of an emergency. This comprehensive residential and living support plays a decisive role in minimizing the difficulties that students may experience in Japan and maximizing their academic achievements.
