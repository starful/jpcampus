## University Overview

The University of the Ryukyus (UoR), established in 1950, is the leading national university in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Founded after World War II, it initially utilized facilities previously occupied by U.S. forces, symbolizing a new beginning for the region.

## International Student Support

The University of the Ryukyus maintains a dedicated International Exchange Center (IEC) to provide comprehensive support for its diverse body of international students, ensuring a smooth transition into both academic life and Okinawan society.

### Admissions Requirements and Application Process

For undergraduate admission, international students generally apply through the direct selection process, which is highly competitive. The primary requirement is performance in the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**, specifically in the subjects required by the desired faculty (e.g., Mathematics Course 2, Japan and the World, and Science or Comprehensive Subjects).

*   **Japanese Language Proficiency:** A strong command of Japanese, typically equivalent to N2 level or higher on the JLPT, is essential for most degree programs, as instruction is primarily conducted in Japanese.
*   **English Programs:** While UoR is primarily a Japanese-medium institution at the undergraduate level, some graduate schools, particularly in specific engineering and science fields, offer research opportunities and courses conducted partially or entirely in English. Prospective graduate students should directly consult the research supervisor.
*   **Secondary Screening:** Successful EJU candidates are invited to an on-campus secondary screening, often involving a comprehensive written exam, practical skills tests (for certain faculties like Medicine or Education), and a crucial interview.

### Housing and Accommodations

UoR recognizes the challenges international students face in securing immediate accommodation and offers specialized housing options:

*   **International House (Kokusai Kōryū Kaikan):** Located close to the campus, this facility offers single rooms or communal apartments specifically reserved for newly admitted international students and researchers. Spaces are limited, and applications must be made well in advance.
*   **Standard Student Dormitories (Gakusei Ryō):** While available, priority often goes to Japanese students, but international students can apply. These dorms offer affordable, basic housing but may require a longer commute.
*   **Guaranteed Support:** The IEC provides assistance in locating affordable off-campus private apartments, often connecting students with local guarantors, which is a common hurdle in Japan's rental market.
