## School Overview & Philosophy

JSL Nihon Academy, located in Urasoe City, Okinawa Prefecture, provides a unique learning environment for international students who aspire to pursue higher education in Japan. Unlike schools concentrated in busy metropolitan areas like Tokyo or Osaka, JSL Nihon Academy offers a more relaxed and culturally distinct experience. Urasoe City combines urban convenience with Okinawan charm, enabling students to immerse themselves in the local culture while still having access to essential amenities. The neighborhood surrounding the academy is generally safe and residential, creating a conducive atmosphere for focused study.

The school's philosophy is centered on providing comprehensive support for students aiming to enter Japanese universities. It recognizes that language proficiency is just one aspect of the preparation process and therefore offers a holistic approach that includes academic guidance, EJU preparation, and career counseling. The relatively smaller city also fosters a strong sense of community within the student body and with the locals.

JSL Nihon Academy aims to foster not only linguistic competence but also a deep understanding of Japanese culture and society. This is achieved through a variety of activities and events that expose students to traditional arts, customs, and social etiquette. This cultural immersion enhances the overall learning experience and prepares students for a smooth transition into Japanese university life. Its strategic location in Okinawa allows students to experience a facet of Japan often overlooked – a region renowned for its distinctive culture, history, and natural beauty, differentiating it from the more mainstream and homogenous view of Japan often portrayed.
