## 🏫 University Overview

Meikai University (明海大学) is a dynamic private institution established in 1970, originally founded as the Josai Dental University. While its origins lie in highly specialized professional education, Meikai has expanded significantly into the humanities, social sciences, and hospitality sectors, focusing on cultivating students with a strong international perspective and practical skills essential for the globalized world. The university operates on two primary campuses: the main Urayasu Campus in Chiba Prefecture, which is a modern hub for the humanities, social sciences, and international studies; and the Sakado Campus in Saitama Prefecture, which houses the prestigious Faculty of Dentistry.

Meikai University’s academic philosophy centers on ‘Self-Discovery’ and ‘Practical Learning.’ It aims to nurture individuals capable of thriving in diverse cultural environments. The Urayasu Campus, located near Tokyo Disney Resort and adjacent to the metropolitan areas of Tokyo, provides an excellent environment for students studying business, tourism, economics, and foreign languages, offering ample opportunities for fieldwork, internships, and cultural engagement. The proximity to global business centers and major tourism hubs gives students in the Faculties of Hospitality and Tourism and Real Estate Sciences a distinct advantage in accessing relevant industry placements and networking opportunities. Furthermore, Meikai University places a high emphasis on proficiency in foreign languages, ensuring that graduates are not only experts in their field but also effective communicators on the international stage.

For international applicants, Meikai primarily requires a high level of Japanese proficiency, demonstrated through the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) and often an internal Japanese language interview. While the institution does not offer extensive English-Taught Programs (ETP) at the undergraduate level, its core mission is centered on facilitating deep integration into Japanese academic and professional life, making it an ideal choice for students committed to mastering the Japanese language and culture.

Meikai University actively pursues research and education that contributes to societal development, particularly through its unique Faculty of Real Estate Sciences—a pioneering program in Japan—and its long-standing reputation in oral healthcare education. The university’s strong institutional commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment is reflected in its active international student body and numerous exchange partnerships worldwide.

## 🎓 Faculties & Departments

Meikai University offers a structured curriculum across five distinct faculties, each designed to provide both specialized knowledge and practical application skills:

### 1. Faculty of Dentistry

Located exclusively on the Sakado Campus, this faculty is the oldest and most renowned division of Meikai University. It maintains a cutting-edge curriculum integrating the latest advancements in dental medicine, research, and technology. The program is rigorous, extending over six years, and prepares students for the highly competitive national licensing examination for dentists in Japan. International students seeking admission here must demonstrate exceptional academic records in science, especially chemistry and biology, in addition to fluency in technical Japanese. The faculty emphasizes clinical training from an early stage, utilizing advanced simulation facilities and affiliated teaching hospitals.

### 2. Faculty of Applied Foreign Languages

Situated at the Urayasu Campus, this faculty is crucial to Meikai’s global mission. It offers intensive language training combined with studies in cultural history, international relations, and business communication. Tracks often include English, Chinese, and specialized studies in global hospitality communication. The curriculum emphasizes communicative competence and cross-cultural understanding, frequently utilizing native-speaking instructors and mandatory short-term study abroad programs to enhance immersion. This faculty prepares students for careers in translation, international business, education, and multinational organizations.

### 3. Faculty of Economics

This faculty provides a comprehensive understanding of economic principles, focusing heavily on practical analysis and quantitative methods. Students can specialize in areas such as regional economics, finance, and international trade. Given the proximity of the Urayasu campus to major financial centers in Tokyo, the program places a strong emphasis on applying theoretical models to contemporary Japanese and global business challenges. Courses often involve case studies and data analysis, preparing graduates for roles in financial institutions, consulting firms, and governmental economic planning.

### 4. Faculty of Real Estate Sciences

Unique among Japanese universities, Meikai’s Faculty of Real Estate Sciences offers an integrated approach to urban development, encompassing law, economics, architecture, finance, and policy. Students gain expertise in asset management, urban planning, housing development, and real estate appraisal. This interdisciplinary approach addresses complex issues of sustainable development and property investment in metropolitan areas. International students interested in urban planning, international property markets, or sustainable city management will find this program particularly relevant. The faculty maintains strong ties with industry professionals, facilitating internships and career placements in major construction and property firms.

### 5. Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism

Leveraging its location near world-class leisure and entertainment destinations, this faculty is dedicated to training high-quality professionals for the booming Japanese tourism sector. The curriculum covers management skills, service quality, destination marketing, and tourism policy. Practical learning is a cornerstone, with extensive field trips, guest lectures from industry leaders, and required internships in hotels, airlines, and travel agencies. The goal is to produce graduates who can manage international resorts and contribute effectively to Japan’s efforts to attract global visitors, requiring high levels of interpersonal communication and language skills.

## 🌍 International Student Support

Meikai University is dedicated to supporting its diverse international student community, recognizing the unique challenges faced when adapting to a new academic and social environment in Japan. Support services span academic guidance, financial aid, and daily life assistance.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships

International students are strongly encouraged to apply for external scholarships, most notably the Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship. Meikai provides dedicated guidance on the application process for these highly competitive awards. Additionally, the university offers its own merit-based tuition reduction scholarships, typically applied after enrollment, based on academic performance during the previous year. These institutional scholarships often cover 30% to 50% of the tuition fees for students who maintain exceptional grades. There are also specific funds available to assist students experiencing sudden financial hardship.

### Japanese Language and Academic Assistance

Recognizing that language proficiency is key to success, the university offers specialized Japanese language support classes tailored for international students who have already achieved the necessary entrance levels (typically N2 or higher). These classes focus on academic Japanese—terminology, essay writing, presentation skills, and research methodology—rather than general conversation. Furthermore, the academic affairs office facilitates a peer-tutoring system, allowing senior students to assist newcomers in navigating challenging coursework, particularly in the quantitative fields of Economics and Real Estate Sciences.

### Housing and Lifestyle Support

While Meikai University has limited dedicated dormitory facilities for the general student body, it prioritizes allocating spaces in subsidized housing or affiliated international dorms for newly arrived foreign students, particularly during their first year. This subsidized housing is highly competitive. For those students seeking private accommodation, the International Affairs office assists with finding appropriate apartments, navigating complex rental contracts, and securing necessary guarantor services, which can be a significant hurdle for international residents in Japan. The office also provides orientation programs covering Japanese customs, transportation, healthcare enrollment, and local civic requirements in Urayasu and Sakado.

### Career Services

Meikai University's Career Support Center provides focused assistance to international students seeking employment in Japan after graduation. Services include specialized workshops on Japanese job-hunting practices (shukatsu), resume and entry sheet preparation (ES), interview training, and guidance on visa requirements for post-graduate employment. The strong industry connections of the Faculties of Real Estate and Hospitality are frequently utilized to organize job fairs and networking events specifically targeting global roles and companies seeking bilingual talent.

## 💰 Tuition & Fees

The tuition structure at Meikai University is standard for a private Japanese institution, but it varies significantly based on the chosen faculty, with Dentistry commanding substantially higher fees due to the intensive lab work, clinical training, and material costs.

### Standard Humanities/Social Sciences (e.g., Economics, Languages, Hospitality, Real Estate)

| Fee Category | Amount (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admission Fee (Entrance Fee)** | ¥300,000 | Paid only upon initial enrollment. |
| **Yearly Tuition Fee** | ¥950,000 - ¥1,100,000 | Varies slightly by faculty. |
| **Facility & Equipment Fee** | ¥150,000 - ¥200,000 | Covers maintenance and access to specialized labs. |
| **Total First Year Estimate** | ¥1,400,000 - ¥1,600,000 | (Excluding mandatory insurance and miscellaneous student body fees). |

### Faculty of Dentistry (Six-Year Program)

Dentistry tuition is significantly higher, reflecting the specialization and resource intensity of the medical field:

| Fee Category | Amount (JPY) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admission Fee (Entrance Fee)** | ¥600,000 | Higher enrollment fee reflects specialized training costs. |
| **Yearly Tuition Fee** | Approx. ¥4,500,000 | One of the most expensive programs. |
| **Facility & Equipment Fee** | Approx. ¥900,000 | Covers clinical materials and simulator maintenance. |
| **Total First Year Estimate** | Over ¥6,000,000 | Requires rigorous financial planning. |

### Payment Schedule and Considerations

Tuition is typically paid in two installments: one at the beginning of the Fall semester and the second at the beginning of the Spring semester. International students must ensure funds are readily available to meet these deadlines. Prospective students should budget an additional ¥600,000 to ¥1,200,000 annually for living expenses (rent, food, transportation, books), especially those studying at the Urayasu Campus where rental costs tend to be higher due to the proximity to Tokyo. The university highly recommends that students secure a portion of their first year's funding prior to arrival, as income from part-time jobs may not be immediately available or sufficient to cover major expenses.
