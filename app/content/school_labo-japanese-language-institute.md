**General 2-Year Course:** This course provides a well-rounded Japanese language education over two years. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, from basic grammar and vocabulary to advanced reading comprehension and writing skills. Teaching methods likely involve a combination of classroom instruction, group activities, and individual assignments. The goal is to develop students' overall language proficiency and enable them to communicate effectively in various situations.

**Higher Education 1.3-Year Course:** Designed for students who already possess a basic understanding of Japanese, this intensive course focuses on preparing them for the challenges of higher education in Japan. The curriculum emphasizes academic Japanese, including specialized vocabulary and grammar used in university lectures and textbooks. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to EJU preparation, with practice tests and strategies for maximizing scores. Teaching methods likely involve a more lecture-based approach, with opportunities for students to ask questions and participate in discussions. The goal is to equip students with the necessary language skills and test-taking strategies to succeed in university entrance exams.
