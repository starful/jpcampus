# Best 4 Schools for Animation, Manga, and Design Progression

Japan is the undisputed global epicenter for animation, manga, and innovative design. For international students dreaming of contributing to this vibrant industry, the journey begins not at the university level, but with rigorous language and academic preparation. Entry into Japan’s top art universities and vocational colleges requires high-level Japanese proficiency, specialized portfolio review guidance, and robust scores on examinations like the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students).

The following curated ranking highlights four exceptional Japanese language institutions that offer specialized academic tracks and dedicated support systems designed specifically to pipeline students successfully into competitive art and design programs across Japan.
