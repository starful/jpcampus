**Curriculum Details:**

The courses listed focus on *進学* (university preparation). These courses are designed to prepare international students for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) and other entrance exams required for admission to Japanese universities. While detailed breakdowns of the class hours aren't available, the curriculum likely includes intensive Japanese language training, covering grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills. Furthermore, the curriculum would likely incorporate EJU subject-specific preparation, potentially including Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics, Science, and Japan and the World.

Due to the limitations of the provided data, specific details concerning the *teaching methodology* are unknown. However, considering the school's emphasis on personalized university guidance, it's reasonable to infer that the teaching style incorporates a student-centered approach. This might involve:

*   Small class sizes that allow for individualized attention.
*   Regular progress assessments to identify areas for improvement.
*   Tailored feedback to help students reach their full potential.

Depending on the course and level, the teaching style may also encompass aspects of communicative language teaching, where students actively engage in discussions and practical exercises to enhance their fluency and confidence in using Japanese.

## Student Body & Campus Life

While precise nationality data is not included in the provided information, the absence of a listed number for international students in the `stats` object (international_students: 0) does NOT necessarily mean there are no international students. It is more likely the number was not reported or easily quantifiable. The features listed ('進学', 'EJU', '기숙사', '역세권', '생활편의시설 우수', '맞춤형 진학지도') imply a clear focus on international students aiming to attend university in Japan. Therefore, although not confirmed, the school likely hosts students from various Asian countries, such as China, Vietnam, Korea, and others, who are strongly motivated to pursue higher education in Japan.

Specific information about the campus facilities, such as the availability of a library, student lounge, or computer access, is not provided in the data. However, as a language school dedicated to university preparation, it is likely that the school is adequately equipped with basic necessities such as classrooms, desks, chairs, and teaching materials. The emphasis on personalized guidance suggests the existence of dedicated consultation spaces where students can meet with academic advisors. The feature "Excellent Living Convenience" further suggests that the school may have good access to nearby facilities beneficial to students.

Based on the available data, specific extracurricular activities and clubs offered by the school are not listed. However, considering the school's commitment to university preparation and cultural adaptation, it's possible that they organize cultural activities, such as tea ceremonies, calligraphy workshops, or field trips to historical sites, to help students immerse themselves in Japanese culture and gain a deeper understanding of the country. These activities would complement their academic studies and enhance their overall experience of living and studying in Japan. Specific information would need to be obtained directly from the school.

## University & Career Pathways

Unfortunately, the provided data does not include specific admission records detailing the universities to which students from AN Language School Narimasu Campus have been admitted. Therefore, it's impossible to provide a list of major universities that students have entered.

The school's primary focus appears to be *university progression support*, as reflected in its course offerings and the feature tag "Personalized University Guidance". The EJU preparation courses are integral to this support. Given that the school explicitly advertises this personalized guidance, students can expect tailored assistance with the university application process, including guidance on selecting appropriate universities based on their academic strengths and interests. The support likely extends to interview practice, helping students develop effective communication skills and prepare for university entrance interviews. Moreover, students likely receive academic counseling to help them navigate the complexities of the Japanese higher education system.

Due to the limited data, no specific details concerning *career support* are provided. However, depending on the student's goals, the school may offer some basic assistance to students looking for part-time work. This could involve providing resources for finding employment opportunities or offering advice on resume writing and interview skills relevant to part-time jobs. However, the main emphasis is on university preparation rather than direct career placement.

## Accommodation & Living Support

The feature tag "Dormitory Available" indicates that AN Language School Narimasu Campus offers *dormitory accommodation* for its students. However, the provided data lacks detailed information about the types of dormitories available, their average monthly cost, distance from the school, and the facilities they offer (e.g., single or shared rooms, kitchen facilities, laundry services). Students considering this school should contact the school directly for these details. Given the location in Narimasu, which is a residential area, accommodation may also include options like apartments.

Although specific details are not provided, it is highly probable that AN Language School Narimasu Campus offers *living assistance* to international students. This assistance likely includes helping students with essential life setup tasks, such as opening a bank account, registering as a resident at the local municipal office, obtaining national health insurance, and searching for part-time job opportunities. The extent of this assistance can vary, but many language schools provide guidance and support to help students navigate these initial challenges and settle into their new lives in Japan. Further information should be obtained directly from the school.
