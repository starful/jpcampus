## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at Shinjuku Japanese Language Institute aligns with the requirements for Japanese higher education, primarily focusing on the two-year General Course, with shorter tracks (1.5-year and 1-year) available based on entry month and visa requirements. The core of SNG's teaching is the General Japanese Course, structured into levels from beginner to advanced. Students are placed into classes based on assessment tests, ensuring optimal learning environments.

The initial phases focus on:

*   Fundamental grammar (Bunkei)
*   Vocabulary acquisition (Goi)
*   Mastering Hiragana, Katakana, and essential Kanji
*   Practical daily communication

As students progress to intermediate levels (JLPT N3/N2), the focus shifts towards:

*   Formal and polite language (Keigo)
*   Reading authentic Japanese texts

The teaching methodology emphasizes interactive learning through:

*   Pair work

*   Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU) preparation
*   Advanced Japanese language skills
*   Subject matter tests: Mathematics, Liberal Arts, and Science
