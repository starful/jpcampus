This course is ideal for students aiming to enter highly competitive universities in Japan.

## Student Body & Campus Life

Given the school's location in a relatively quiet part of Tokyo, and its specialization in preparing students for higher education, the student body is likely composed of a diverse range of nationalities, with a significant proportion of students from Asian countries such as China, Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Students from Western countries like the United States, Canada, and Europe may also be represented, albeit in smaller numbers.

Given the school's relatively small size, the atmosphere is likely to be intimate and supportive, fostering a sense of community among students and staff.

Extracurricular activities likely play a vital role in the school's efforts to immerse students in Japanese culture. These activities could include field trips to historical sites, cultural events, and museums, as well as participation in traditional Japanese arts and crafts, such as calligraphy, tea ceremony, and origami. The school may also organize social events, such as parties, karaoke nights, and sports tournaments, to encourage students to interact with each other and build friendships. Furthermore, the school could collaborate with local community organizations to provide students with opportunities to volunteer and engage with Japanese society. These extracurricular activities not only enhance students' language skills but also broaden their cultural understanding and create lasting memories of their time in Japan.
