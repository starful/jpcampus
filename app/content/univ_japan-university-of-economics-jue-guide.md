## University Overview

The Japan University of Economics (JUE), also known as Nihon Keizai Daigaku in Japanese, is a dynamic private institution that emphasizes the development of globally competent business leaders and entrepreneurs. Unlike many traditional Japanese universities with a single location, JUE operates a unique multi-campus system across three major economic centers: the main campus in **Fukuoka** (Kyushu), a strategic campus in **Kobe Sannomiya** (Kansai), and an innovative hub in **Tokyo Shibuya** (Kanto). This geographical distribution provides international students with exceptional flexibility and exposure to diverse Japanese business environments, ranging from the tech-driven atmosphere of Tokyo to the logistics and trade focus of Kobe, and the historically and culturally rich, yet rapidly growing market of Fukuoka.

Established with the core mission of fostering practical economic and business skills, JUE’s curriculum is strongly career-oriented. It prioritizes real-world application through internships, practical training seminars, and collaborations with regional businesses. The university stands out by maintaining a high percentage of international students, particularly from East and Southeast Asia, which cultivates a truly international learning environment. This environment is specifically tailored for students who want to master Japanese language and business culture and apply these skills directly in the global marketplace after graduation. JUE is an excellent choice for those seeking robust professional networks and a fast track into the Japanese or Asian job markets.

The academic structure is designed to be responsive to global economic changes, moving beyond purely theoretical knowledge. While economics and management remain core disciplines, the expansion into specialized fields like global entrepreneurship and design reflects a commitment to 21st-century skills. The university is proud of its high graduate employment rate, a testament to its hands-on approach and extensive career guidance programs.

## Faculties & Departments

JUE offers a variety of undergraduate programs, strategically located across its three campuses to leverage regional economic strengths and student interests. While the overarching theme is business and management, the specific focus varies significantly by campus and faculty:

### Fukuoka Campus (The Main Hub)

*   **Faculty of Economics:** This foundational faculty provides rigorous training in macro- and microeconomics, focusing on policy analysis, financial markets, and the economic structure of Asia. It's essential for students seeking roles in finance, government, or international trade analysis.
*   **Faculty of Business Management:** Focused heavily on practical corporate skills, this faculty covers diverse fields such as strategic management, marketing, accounting, and supply chain logistics. There is a major emphasis on Japanese business practices (Keiei) and cross-cultural management.
*   **Faculty of Design:** A unique offering that blends creative thinking with business acumen. Departments within this faculty focus on product design, visual communication, and industrial design management, preparing students to lead creative teams and develop marketable products.

### Kobe Sannomiya Campus

*   **Faculty of Contemporary Business:** Leveraging Kobe’s historical role as a major port and logistics center, this faculty specializes in modern business administration, international logistics, and regional economic development. The program is tailored for students interested in import/export, global supply chains, and market entry strategies into Japan.

### Tokyo Shibuya Campus

*   **Faculty of Global Business and Entrepreneurship:** Situated in the heart of Japan's most competitive business district, this faculty is intensely focused on innovation, venture creation, and digital business strategies. It offers specialized courses in FinTech, startup culture, and global corporate strategy, utilizing the proximity to major international companies and startup accelerators. This environment is ideal for highly ambitious students aiming to launch their own companies or secure positions in multinational corporations based in Tokyo.

All faculties integrate substantial Japanese language instruction and cultural immersion components, recognizing that fluency and cultural competence are essential for success in the Japanese employment market.

## International Student Support

Japan University of Economics is known for its robust and comprehensive support system tailored specifically for its large international student body. This support covers academic, financial, and residential needs, ensuring a smoother transition and successful academic experience in Japan.

### Scholarships and Financial Aid

JUE understands the financial commitment required for international study and offers several key internal scholarship programs, often awarded upon successful admission or based on academic performance after enrollment:

*   **JUE International Student Scholarship:** A highly sought-after scholarship that often provides significant tuition reduction, potentially covering up to 30% to 50% of the annual tuition fee for high-achieving applicants.
*   **Performance-Based Tuition Reduction:** Merit scholarships are often available from the second year onward, rewarding students who maintain exceptionally high GPAs.
*   **JASSO and External Scholarships:** JUE actively assists students in applying for external governmental scholarships, most notably the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) scholarships, which provide monthly stipends.

### Residential and Living Support

The university provides access to dedicated international student dormitories (Gakusei Ryo) near its major campuses, particularly in Fukuoka and Kobe. These dormitories offer affordable, secure housing options designed to ease the transition into Japanese life. Dormitory management often includes bilingual staff to assist with daily life, contract negotiation, and emergency support. Furthermore, staff assist in navigating local administrative requirements, such as resident registration and national health insurance enrollment.

### Academic and Career Guidance

JUE places significant emphasis on career outcomes. The Career Center offers specialized guidance for international students, including:

*   **Job Hunting Seminars:** Focused specifically on the unique challenges international students face in the Japanese Shushoku Katsudo (job hunting) process, covering resume writing (ES), interview etiquette, and SPI aptitude tests.
*   **Internship Placement:** Mandatory or elective internship opportunities with affiliated companies, providing vital work experience and networking opportunities.
*   **Japanese Business Language Training:** Supplementary classes focused on Keigo (polite Japanese) and technical Japanese terminology required for professional settings.
*   **Visa Support:** Comprehensive support for extending student visas and changing status to work visas upon graduation.

## Tuition & Fees

Studying at Japan University of Economics represents a significant investment, comparable to other high-quality private universities in Japan. However, prospective students should always consider the strong possibility of securing tuition reduction through the university’s generous scholarship schemes.
