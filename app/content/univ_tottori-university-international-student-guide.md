## 🏫 University Overview

Tottori University, known locally as "Toridai," is a prestigious national university located in the San'in region of Japan. Established in 1949, the university has built a reputation as a research-intensive institution that prioritizes solving global challenges through local innovation. While Tottori is Japan's least populous prefecture, the university punches far above its weight, particularly in the fields of agricultural science, arid land research, and medical innovation. For international students, Tottori University offers a unique blend of high-quality Japanese national education and a peaceful, scenic environment that is conducive to deep study and community integration.

The university is divided into two main campuses: the Koyama Campus in Tottori City, which houses the Faculties of Regional Sciences, Engineering, and Agriculture; and the Yonago Campus, which is home to the Faculty of Medicine. This geographic distribution allows students to experience different facets of Japanese life, from the coastal beauty of the Tottori Sand Dunes to the bustling medical hub of Yonago.

## 🎓 Academic Faculties and Specialties

### Faculty of Agriculture
This is perhaps the most famous faculty at Tottori University. It is home to the world-renowned Arid Land Research Center (ALRC). Students here engage in cutting-edge research regarding desertification, water resource management, and crop production in harsh environments. This makes it a primary destination for international students from Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The faculty offers programs in Bioresource Science and Life Environmental Science.

### Faculty of Engineering
The Faculty of Engineering is divided into several specialized departments including Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Information and Electronics, and Applied Chemistry. The curriculum is heavily weighted toward practical application, with strong ties to Japanese manufacturing industries. International students benefit from the university's career support, which helps bridge the gap between academic study and the Japanese corporate world.

### Faculty of Regional Sciences
This faculty focuses on the revitalization of local communities. It is ideal for students interested in sociology, economics, and environmental policy within a Japanese context. It emphasizes fieldwork and active engagement with the Tottori local government and NGOs, providing a practical look at how Japan handles its demographic shifts and rural development.

### Faculty of Medicine
Located in Yonago City, this faculty includes the School of Medicine and the School of Health Sciences. It is attached to the Tottori University Hospital, one of the most advanced medical facilities in Western Japan. The faculty is known for its research in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.

## 🌍 Global Research: The Arid Land Research Center (ALRC)

Tottori University hosts the ALRC, a Joint Usage/Research Center recognized by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Because Tottori is home to the famous Tottori Sand Dunes, the university utilized this natural laboratory to become a global leader in combating desertification. International students often collaborate on projects funded by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), working on sustainable development goals that impact the entire planet. This provides a level of global networking that is rarely found in regional universities.

## 📝 Admission Process for International Students

Applying to Tottori University as an international student typically involves several pathways:

1.  **Privately Financed Students (Undergraduate):** Applicants must take the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU). Most faculties require scores in Japanese as a Foreign Language, Science (or Japan and the World), and Mathematics. Following the EJU, candidates must pass a university-specific entrance exam which usually includes an interview and an essay in Japanese.
2.  **MEXT Scholarship:** Students can apply through the Japanese Embassy in their home country or via university recommendation. This is highly competitive but covers tuition and provides a monthly stipend.
3.  **Graduate Admissions:** For Master’s and Doctoral programs, applicants must usually find a research supervisor first. Direct communication with professors is essential. The selection process involves a review of the research proposal and an oral examination.

## 💰 Tuition and Financial Support

As a national university, Tottori University offers standardized tuition rates which are significantly lower than private universities in Japan.
- **Admission Fee:** ¥282,000 (one-time payment)
- **Annual Tuition:** ¥535,800 (split into two semesters)

To support international students, Tottori University offers a **Tuition Waiver System**. Depending on academic performance and financial need, students can receive a 50% or 100% exemption from tuition fees. Additionally, there are numerous local scholarships provided by foundations in the Tottori area specifically for international residents, such as the Tottori Prefecture International Exchange Foundation scholarships.

## 🏠 Student Life and Cost of Living

One of the greatest advantages of studying in Tottori is the cost of living. Rent for a single-occupancy apartment near the Koyama campus can range from ¥25,000 to ¥45,000 per month—nearly a third of the price of similar housing in Tokyo. 

### Accommodation
The university operates the **International House**, which provides affordable dormitory-style living for newcomers. This is an excellent way for students to transition into Japanese life while meeting peers from around the world. Most international students move into private apartments after their first year, assisted by the university’s co-op (Seikyo).

### Student Support
The International Affairs Division provides comprehensive support, including:
- **Tutor System:** New international students are paired with a Japanese student tutor who helps them with daily life, opening bank accounts, and language practice for the first six months.
- **Japanese Language Courses:** The university offers various levels of Japanese language education, from survival Japanese to academic writing for research.

## 🏞️ Exploring Tottori

Life in Tottori is perfect for nature lovers. The Tottori Sand Dunes (Sakyu) offer camel rides and sandboarding. To the east, the Uradome Coast provides crystal-clear waters for snorkeling and kayaking. To the west, Mount Daisen offers world-class hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter. The region is also famous for its seafood, particularly Matsuba crab, and its world-renowned 20th Century Pears (Nijisseiki Nashi).

The local community is exceptionally welcoming to international students. Because there are fewer foreigners than in major metropolises, students often find themselves invited to local festivals, tea ceremonies, and community events, leading to a much higher level of Japanese language immersion.

## 💼 Career Prospects

Tottori University has a strong reputation among Japanese employers for producing hard-working and technically proficient graduates. The university’s Career Center offers specific guidance for international students, including workshops on Japanese business etiquette and job interview preparation. 

Graduates from the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Agriculture frequently find employment in major Japanese corporations in the Chugoku and Kansai regions.
