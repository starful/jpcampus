## Understanding National Health Insurance (NHI) in Japan: A Guide for International Students

Hello fellow international students! Adjusting to a new life in Japan is exciting, but also comes with its own set of administrative tasks. One of the most important things you'll need to sort out is your National Health Insurance (NHI), or _Kokumin Kenko Hoken_ (国民健康保険) in Japanese. This blog post aims to clarify what NHI is, how it works, and how you can potentially reduce your premiums.

### What is National Health Insurance (NHI)?

The National Health Insurance is a mandatory health insurance system in Japan designed to ensure everyone has access to affordable medical care. As an international student residing in Japan for longer than three months, you are legally required to enroll in NHI. It covers a wide range of medical services, from doctor's visits and hospital stays to prescriptions. Essentially, it's your safety net in case you get sick or injured during your stay.

### The 30% Co-pay

While NHI covers a significant portion of your medical expenses, you're still responsible for a co-payment. For most people, including students, this co-pay is **30%** of the total medical bill. This means that if a doctor's visit costs ¥10,000, you'll pay ¥3,000, and NHI will cover the remaining ¥7,000. While it's still a cost, it's significantly less than paying the full amount without insurance.

### Key to Saving Money: The "Premium Reduction" (Gengaku)

Here's where things get really important for students! Many international students have limited or no income while studying. Thankfully, the Japanese government offers a system called _Gengaku_ (減額), or "premium reduction," specifically designed to help individuals with low or no income.

**How does it work?** If you can demonstrate to your local city hall that you have little to no income, you can apply for a significant reduction in your NHI premiums. The amount of the reduction depends on your individual circumstances and the city you live in, but it can be substantial.

**How to apply?**

1. **Go to your local city hall (Shiyakusho 市役所).** Find the insurance section (_Hoken-ka_ 保険課).
2. **Tell them you want to apply for _Gengaku_ (減額) for your National Health Insurance.**
3. **Bring your residence card (Zairyu Card 在留カード) and your NHI card.**
4. **Explain that you are a student and have little or no income.** Be prepared to answer questions about your financial situation.
5. **Fill out the application form.** The staff will assist you, but it's helpful to have a Japanese-speaking friend or translator if you're not confident in your Japanese.
6. **Submit the form.**

**Important Considerations:**

- You'll need to re-apply for _Gengaku_ every year.
- The application process can vary slightly depending on your city.
- If you start working part-time, you may no longer be eligible for a full reduction.
- Don't delay! Apply as soon as you receive your NHI bill.

### NHI vs. No Insurance: A Quick Comparison

Here's a simple table to illustrate the difference between having NHI and not having it:

| Scenario              | With NHI (and 30% Co-pay) | Without NHI             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Doctor's Visit        | ¥3,000                    | ¥10,000                 |
| Hospital Stay (Short) | ¥30,000                   | ¥100,000                |
| Serious Illness       | Significant Coverage      | Potentially Bankrupting |
| Peace of Mind         | High                      | Low                     |

### Conclusion: Prioritize Your Health and Finances

Enrolling in National Health Insurance is not just a legal requirement, it's a crucial step in protecting your health and financial well-being while studying in Japan. Don't underestimate the importance of applying for the "premium reduction" (_Gengaku_) if you're eligible. Take the time to visit your city hall and explore your options. It could save you a significant amount of money and provide you with peace of mind throughout your stay. Remember to prioritize your health, and good luck with your studies!
