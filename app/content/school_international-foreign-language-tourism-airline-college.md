## 🏫 School Overview & Philosophy

**Kokusai Gaigo Kanko Airline Senmon Gakko (国際外語・観光・エアライン専門学校)**, translated as the **International Foreign Language, Tourism, & Airline College**, is a specialized vocational school situated in the heart of Niigata City, Niigata Prefecture. Nestled in the Furumachi district (specifically, Niigata-ken, Niigata-shi, Chuo-ku, Furumachi-dori 7-chome 1004-1), the school enjoys a central location with easy access to local amenities and transportation. The Furumachi area is known for its blend of traditional shops, modern businesses, and cultural attractions, providing students with a vibrant and enriching environment to experience Japanese culture firsthand. Unlike the bustling metropolis of Tokyo, Niigata offers a more relaxed and authentic experience of Japanese life, making it an ideal setting for focused study.

Founded with a mission to cultivate globally-minded professionals, the International Foreign Language, Tourism, & Airline College has a rich history of providing students with the practical skills and theoretical knowledge necessary to succeed in a diverse range of international industries. The school's philosophy is rooted in the belief that language proficiency is the key to unlocking global opportunities. Therefore, the Japanese Language Department serves as a crucial stepping stone for international students aspiring to further their education or careers within Japan or beyond.

The college emphasizes a hands-on, experiential approach to learning, moving beyond traditional classroom lectures to incorporate practical exercises, simulations, and real-world case studies. This approach is particularly evident in the school's commitment to conversational fluency, ensuring that students can confidently communicate in Japanese in a variety of professional and social contexts. The relatively small class sizes (implied by the school's total capacity of 100 students) allow for personalized attention and a close-knit learning community, fostering a supportive environment where students can thrive.

Ultimately, the International Foreign Language, Tourism, & Airline College aims to empower students with the linguistic and cultural competence needed to navigate the complexities of the global marketplace. By providing comprehensive support for higher education progression, career development, and comfortable living arrangements, the school strives to create a holistic educational experience that prepares students for long-term success in their chosen fields.

**日本語科2年コース (Japanese Dept. 2-year Course):** This comprehensive two-year course is designed for students with little to no prior knowledge of Japanese. The curriculum follows a structured progression, starting with the fundamentals of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. A significant portion of class time is dedicated to conversational practice, using interactive activities, role-playing scenarios, and group discussions to build fluency and confidence. Students will also delve into the complexities of the Japanese writing system, mastering a substantial number of kanji characters. Furthermore, the course incorporates elements of Japanese culture, history, and customs, providing a broader understanding of the language and its context. The teaching style is highly communicative, encouraging active participation and creating a supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable making mistakes and learning from them. EJU preparation is integrated throughout the curriculum, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the exam should they wish to pursue higher education in Japan. The course also incorporates project-based learning, allowing students to apply their language skills to real-world tasks, such as conducting interviews, creating presentations, and writing reports.

**日本語科1.5年コース (Japanese Dept. 1.5-year Course):** This accelerated 1.5-year course caters to students who possess some prior knowledge of Japanese, equivalent to approximately N5-N4 level. Building upon existing foundations, the curriculum focuses on rapidly advancing students' language skills in all four areas: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. While covering the same essential grammar and vocabulary as the two-year course, the 1.5-year program moves at a faster pace, demanding greater commitment and independent study. The teaching style is equally communicative but with a stronger emphasis on practical application and real-world scenarios. Students engage in more advanced conversational activities, such as debates, presentations, and simulations of professional interactions. Kanji study is also intensified, with a focus on mastering a larger number of characters in a shorter timeframe. Like the two-year course, EJU preparation is a key component, ensuring that students are equipped to succeed in their academic aspirations. The course design emphasizes independent learning and self-directed study, encouraging students to take ownership of their learning process and to actively seek opportunities to practice and improve their Japanese skills outside of the classroom.
