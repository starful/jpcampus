## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

Sagami International Academy offers two main long-term courses designed to prepare students for university entrance in Japan. The curriculum is comprehensive and structured, focusing on both general Japanese language skills and specific subjects needed for the EJU and university entrance exams.

*   **University Prep Course I:** A two-year program for students from beginner to advanced levels. It includes comprehensive Japanese language training, EJU preparation (all subjects), university entrance exam preparation, interview practice, guidance on university selection, and cultural activities.
*   **University Prep Course II:** A 1.5-year accelerated program for students from beginner to advanced levels. It includes accelerated Japanese language training, EJU preparation (all subjects), university entrance exam preparation, interview practice, guidance on university selection, and cultural activities.

**University Prep Course I (進学コース Ⅰ):** This two-year course is the main program at Sagami International Academy, designed for students who want to start their Japanese language studies from the beginning and reach an advanced level for university entrance. The curriculum is carefully structured and covers all areas of the Japanese language, including grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. In the first year, students build a strong foundation in basic Japanese, learning essential grammar and expanding their vocabulary. The second year focuses on improving their language skills and preparing for the EJU and university entrance exams. Special attention is given to EJU subjects like Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics, Science (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology), and Japan and the World. The teaching style is interactive and communicative, encouraging students to participate in class discussions, group projects, and presentations. Regular assessments are conducted to track student progress and identify areas where they need more support. The course also includes cultural activities and field trips to help students understand Japanese society and culture.

**University Prep Course II (進学コース Ⅱ):** This 1.5-year course is a faster program for students who already have some Japanese knowledge or who learn quickly. The curriculum is similar to the two-year course, but the pace is faster and more intense. Students are expected to learn a lot of material in a shorter time. The teaching style is more demanding, requiring students to be highly motivated and self-disciplined. The curriculum covers all areas of the Japanese language and prepares students for the EJU and university entrance exams. Like the University Prep Course I, specialized instruction is provided for EJU subjects, including Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics, Science, and Japan and the World. The instructors use various teaching methods, including lectures, discussions, group work, and individual tutoring. Students are also encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities to improve their language skills and cultural understanding. This course is ideal for students who are determined to enter a Japanese university as quickly as possible.
