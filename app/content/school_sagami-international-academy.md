The school’s educational philosophy centers on a holistic approach to language learning, integrating grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills into a cohesive and engaging curriculum. A defining feature of Sagami International Academy is its specialized focus on university advancement, particularly for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.

Beyond academic excellence, the academy places a strong emphasis on fostering intercultural understanding and personal development, equipping students with the skills and confidence to thrive in Japanese society.
