## 🏫 School Overview & Philosophy

The Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute is located in Ikebukuro, Toshima Ward, Tokyo, one of Japan's leading academic centers. With a small class size (capacity of 180 students), it is a specialized Japanese language education institution that focuses on providing customized education to each student. The school's core educational philosophy goes beyond simple language acquisition. It aims to cultivate academic foundations and high-level communication skills that allow students to successfully advance to Japanese higher education institutions (universities, graduate schools, vocational schools) and adapt to Japanese society. Ikebukuro is one of Tokyo's three major sub-centers, along with Shinjuku and Shibuya, and provides a wealth of transportation convenience, cultural facilities, and a scholarly environment with a concentration of universities, making it an ideal condition for international students to focus on their studies. The school takes advantage of this geographical advantage to provide students with opportunities to balance local life and learning. In particular, because the school is not large, close relationships between faculty and students are possible, which is the basis for careful management of academic and overall life. Kokusai Academy's three pillars are 'sincere education,' 'clear career guidance,' and 'warm life support,' and it provides full support to help students achieve their desired advancement goals and lead successful study abroad lives in Japan. The school operates a strict attendance and grade management system every year, encouraging responsible learning attitudes.

The school's main goal is for students to obtain high scores on the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) and JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) and to pass the entrance exams for their desired universities. To this end, the advanced studies class is set as the core curriculum, and individual learning consulting is provided from the beginning of enrollment. In particular, the school focuses on developing comprehensive academic skills such as interview manners, essay writing skills, and academic presentation and discussion skills required at Japanese universities, as well as Japanese language proficiency. Because the school is located close to areas where major private universities are concentrated, students can easily obtain information about the universities they want and participate in open campus events. In addition, the school operates not only long-term courses but also short-term study abroad programs to meet the needs of international students with various learning goals. This multifaceted educational approach embodies the vision of 'cultivating global human resources' that the Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute aims for.

Another important feature of this school is that 'Dormitory Provided' is included in its core services. The soaring housing costs in Tokyo and the complicated real estate contract process are a major burden for international students. Kokusai Academy provides school-designated or operated dormitories to help students settle down smoothly in the initial stages, allowing them to solve housing problems at the same time as starting their studies. This provides psychological stability, especially for students who are new to life in Japan, and creates an environment where they can concentrate solely on their studies. The school closely monitors each student's academic achievement through a small-group education system, and immediately provides individual supplementary learning or customized advancement guidance as needed. As a result, Kokusai Academy presents a model of a truly 'study-focused' Japanese language school that combines strict academic management with warm life support.

## 📚 Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum of the Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute is designed entirely with a focus on 'advancement to higher education.' Students are assigned to classes according to their Japanese language level at the time of enrollment, but the highest-level classes consist of in-depth learning aimed at preparing for the Examination for Japanese University Admission (EJU) and acquiring JLPT N1 certification. The school offers flexible advancement paths tailored to students' learning period goals through four enrollment periods: April (2 years), July (1 year and 9 months), October (1 year and 6 months), and January (1 year and 3 months). The curriculum focuses not on simply memorizing grammar and vocabulary, but on developing the four skills of 'listening, speaking, reading, and writing' in a balanced manner, as required in the actual classroom environment of Japanese universities. In particular, in the intermediate and higher levels, academic text reading, basic business Japanese, and logical writing training are strengthened to help students build the academic background knowledge to follow classes in the humanities and social sciences at Japanese universities.

The school also incorporates 'business Japanese' education elements into the curriculum, providing practical assistance to students who aim to find employment after graduation or who wish to work for Japanese companies after graduation. This includes business manners, polite language usage, and how to write resumes and cover letters, providing practical socialization education that goes beyond simple language education. The faculty consists of veterans with many years of experience in educating international students, and provides specialized guidance to help students accurately understand and overcome the subtle nuances and cultural differences of the Japanese language. In particular, after-school or supplementary classes are provided outside of the regular curriculum to prepare for EJU subjects (mathematics, comprehensive subjects, and science), allowing students to complete all necessary advancement preparation within the school without relying on private tutoring schools.

*   **Advanced Studies 2-Year Course:** The most standard and stable course for advancing to universities/graduate schools. Step-by-step completion from basic Japanese to EJU and thesis writing. (April intake, 24 months, JLPT N1, High EJU score)
*   **Advanced Studies 1.9-Year Course:** An intensive course suitable for students with some basic knowledge or who wish to advance quickly. (July intake, 21 months, JLPT N1 or N2 upper level)
*   **Advanced Studies 1.6-Year Course:** A short-term intensive class for students with a relatively high level of Japanese (N4-N5 level) or who aim to enroll quickly. (October intake, 18 months, JLPT N2 or higher)
*   **Advanced Studies 1.3-Year Course:** The highest-level intensive class for those who already have a considerable level of Japanese (N3 or higher) and aim to advance within one year. Focus on EJU preparation. (January intake, 15 months, JLPT N1 is a must)
*   **Short-Term Intensive Course:** A course that can be taken without a visa for up to 3 months. Focus on conversation and cultural experience. (Always available, 1 month to 3 months, improving conversational skills)

The school accurately diagnoses students' current positions through regular mock exams and grade counseling, and continuously adjusts their learning plans. This plays a decisive role in providing students with the most efficient learning strategies, especially in an entrance examination environment where EJU scores fluctuate from time to time. In addition to classroom lessons, the school also strives to build a self-directed learning environment where students can continue learning on their own by utilizing Japanese language learning apps, online materials, and more.

## 🌍 Student Body & Campus Life

The student body of the Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute is mainly composed of students from East Asian countries (Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc.) with a clear goal of advancing to higher education. However, in recent years, the proportion of students from Europe and North America has gradually increased, and diverse cultural backgrounds coexist on campus. Learning takes place in an atmosphere that encourages interaction and cooperation among students, taking advantage of the benefits of a small school, which helps to develop not only Japanese language skills but also international sensibilities and understanding. The student capacity of 180 is the optimal size for teachers to understand the names and learning progress of all students and pay individual attention. This environment is particularly beneficial in minimizing the cultural shock or loneliness experienced by students from abroad.

Campus life is very rich and convenient because it is based in Ikebukuro, a core area of Tokyo. Ikebukuro is a major terminal station where JR, private railways, and subway lines converge. It is famous for large commercial facilities such as Seibu Department Store and Tobu Department Store, and 'Otome Road,' where manga/anime-related stores are gathered. In addition, prestigious universities such as Rikkyo University are located nearby, creating a scholarly atmosphere. Students can easily secure self-study time by using nearby libraries or book cafes after school, and various part-time job opportunities are also easily accessible.

In addition to regular learning, Kokusai Academy regularly holds various cultural experience activities that allow students to deeply understand Japanese culture. For example, participation in Japanese holidays and festivals (Matsuri), tea ceremony (Sado) experience, calligraphy (Shodo) classes, and traditional craft production experience are included. These activities provide students with opportunities to use the language they have learned in the classroom in real-life situations and help them connect more closely with Japanese society. In addition, student council activities and sports days are held regularly within the school to promote friendship among students and encourage a healthy school life. These activities also have a positive impact on students' stress relief and Japanese conversation skills.

## 🎓 University & Career Pathways

The strongest asset of the Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute is its thorough and systematic 'advancement guidance system.' The school supports students not only in becoming proficient in Japanese but also in perfectly understanding and preparing for the Japanese university entrance examination system. The advancement guidance program consists of three main pillars: high-scoring EJU strategies, customized guidance for each target university, and intensive training in interviews and essays.

First, preparation for the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) is at the core of the regular curriculum. Supplementary and advanced lectures are provided not only for Japanese language subjects but also for mathematics, comprehensive subjects (geography, history, politics, economics), and science (physics, chemistry, biology) subjects for humanities/science students. These lectures are given by specialized EJU instructors, and mock exams that reflect the latest question trends are conducted regularly to objectively evaluate students' abilities. Second, in customized guidance for each target university, the list of universities to apply to is set together, taking into consideration each student's desired major and academic level. In this process, the entrance examination guidelines of each university (whether TOEFL is required, the type of the main exam, the interview method, etc.) are analyzed in detail, and the most advantageous strategy for students is established. Teachers promote students' psychological stability and motivation to advance through regular one-on-one career counseling.

Third, guidance on essays and interviews. Many prestigious universities in Japan evaluate academic potential and logical thinking skills through essays or in-depth interviews separately from Japanese language ability in the entrance examination for international students. The Kokusai Academy treats this part very seriously, teaching how to write essays with a logical structure through specialized instructors, and carefully correcting the essays written by students. Interview preparation is conducted by repeatedly conducting mock interviews that reproduce the actual university interview situation, and customized feedback is provided to prepare for questions tailored to the characteristics of the faculty/graduate school to which the student is applying. This helps students to confidently and clearly convey their academic plans and goals in the interview. Graduates have successfully advanced to major private and national/public universities throughout Japan, including Waseda University, Meiji University, and Rikkyo University, and the school uses these advancement cases as a basis for the advancement strategies of the next generation of students.

## 🏡 Accommodation & Living Support

The Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute greatly reduces the initial settlement burden of international students starting their lives in Tokyo by providing 'dormitories' as a major amenity. Dormitories that are directly managed or affiliated with the school are located in convenient locations for commuting to school (mainly Ikebukuro or nearby areas), and are selected with the highest priority given to safety and living convenience. Dormitory options mainly consist of single or double rooms and can be selected according to the student's budget and preferences. Most dormitories are equipped with basic furniture (bed, desk, air conditioner, etc.), kitchen facilities (shared or individual), and laundry facilities. This is a very important support measure that helps students start a stable life as soon as they arrive in Japan.

The initial settlement support service does not stop at simply providing accommodation. Through an orientation immediately after entry, the school provides detailed information essential for life in Japan, such as living rules in Tokyo, medical insurance enrollment procedures, how to open a bank account, and how to set up a mobile phone. In addition, a map of living information (supermarkets, hospitals, ward offices, etc.) in the Ikebukuro area is provided to help students quickly become familiar with the surrounding environment. When faced with difficulties due to the Japanese language or administrative problems, the school office has a system in place to respond at all times, with staff who can provide multilingual support so that students can ask for help.

Support for students who wish to work part-time is also active. The school operates a job posting board to help students find suitable part-time jobs within the scope permitted by the Immigration Control Act, and provides advice on resume writing and interview preparation. This comprehensive living support is an important differentiator for Kokusai Academy, allowing students to concentrate solely on achieving their goals of advancing to higher education without worrying about matters other than their studies.

## 💰 Tuition, Fees & Scholarships

The tuition fees of the Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute are maintained at the average level of private Japanese language schools located in the center of Tokyo, but are considered reasonable when considering the quality of education provided, the advancement support system, and the value of dormitory affiliation services.

**Scholarships and Financial Aid System:**

The Kokusai Academy Japanese Language Institute operates various scholarship programs to encourage students who show excellent academic achievement and exemplary school life. The most representative is the recommendation system for the 'Private Foreign Student Learning Encouragement Fee' sponsored by the Japanese government (JASSO). The school selects diligent and potential students based on strict criteria (high attendance rate, excellent grades, clear advancement goals) and recommends them to JASSO. If selected, this scholarship allows students to receive a fixed amount each month, greatly reducing the financial burden of studying abroad. In addition, the school motivates students to learn through its own academic excellence scholarships, perfect attendance scholarships, and more. Thanks to the small-group system under the school's management, information on scholarship opportunities is delivered to students quickly and accurately.

In addition, the tuition fee installment payment system plays an important role in alleviating students' financial burden. In the case of long-term courses, students are allowed to pay the total tuition fee in installments of 6 months or 1 year instead of paying it in a lump sum, taking into consideration that international students can flexibly plan their finances. Students can receive detailed information on financial aid systems through the school office at the time of enrollment. The Kokusai Academy aims to provide an integrated study abroad environment that goes beyond simply providing educational services and also considers the financial stability of students.
