## School Overview & Philosophy

Waseda EDU Japanese Language School, as the name suggests, is a specialized educational institution that prioritizes admission to prestigious Japanese universities and graduate schools over simple Japanese language learning. Located in Ichigaya, Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's core educational centers, it provides students with an optimal environment to quickly access the latest entrance exam information and leverage the surrounding academic infrastructure. With a large capacity of 960 students, the school boasts a systematic and extensive education system and operates a robust curriculum designed to maximize each student's academic achievement. The school's educational philosophy emphasizes 'Goal-Oriented Learning,' meaning that all classes and management systems are designed to help students pass into their desired top-tier universities. In particular, its educational system specialized in preparing for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) is considered one of the school's greatest strengths. The school demands strict academic discipline from its students and provides continuous feedback and in-depth learning opportunities based on academic performance, establishing itself as a cradle for producing some of the most competitive international students in Japan.

Because students with solid academic backgrounds gather at Waseda EDU, the campus atmosphere itself is very academic and competitive. The school provides full support so that students can complete their Japanese language proficiency (JLPT N1 or higher) early on, as well as aim for perfect scores in each EJU subject. Its mission is to provide 'Pre-University' education to help students successfully settle into the Japanese academic environment, going beyond a simple language acquisition institution. This approach provides unique benefits, especially for students wishing to advance in science and engineering fields (Rika), as it offers specialized science and mathematics education that is often difficult to find in Japanese language schools. The school focuses on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills that can meet the academic requirements of Japanese universities, going beyond simply conveying knowledge. Under this philosophy, Waseda EDU achieves high acceptance rates to prestigious universities every year, playing a leading role in education for international students.

The school's administrative support team and teachers understand the complexities of Japanese university entrance exams and carefully guide students to avoid unnecessary trial and error. To manage a large number of students while identifying each student's career goals, regular counseling sessions and analysis of academic performance trends are essential. In particular, basic education on Japanese life and culture is also provided to help students adapt early on, but its importance is set lower compared to academic achievement. Waseda EDU presents students with a clear vision of 'successful admission' and concentrates on providing all the educational resources and environment needed to achieve this. This ultimately helps students maximize their academic efficiency during their short study abroad period.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at Waseda EDU Japanese Language School is mainly focused on the 進学コース (University Preparatory Course), which is thoroughly designed around 'admission to universities and graduate schools.' It offers study periods from 1 year and 3 months to 2 years depending on the admission period, and students can choose the optimal course according to their academic plan. The curriculum is structured from the beginner level to thoroughly target EJU preparation and JLPT N1 acquisition. While typical Japanese language schools focus on improving conversational skills, Waseda EDU focuses on fostering academic Japanese proficiency, that is, logical writing, understanding of specialized terms, and the ability to analyze complex texts.

**1. EJU Specialized Training:**
The most important feature is providing education through specialized instructors for each EJU subject. In particular, education for those wishing to advance in science (理科) is very systematic. While general Japanese language schools tend to focus on preparing for humanities subjects (integrated subjects), Waseda EDU provides in-depth learning for science subjects such as mathematics courses (Course 1/Course 2), physics, chemistry, and biology in the form of regular or supplementary classes. This specialized subject education is sometimes conducted by specialized instructors (non-Japanese) who are fluent in the students' native language, who ensure they fully understand complex concepts before converting them into specialized Japanese terms. This is crucial in helping students establish basic knowledge in their major field before listening to university lectures in Japanese. Classes go beyond simply memorizing textbook content and are conducted in the form of analyzing past questions, solving expected problems, and mock exams for time management to maximize practical skills.

**2. University-Specific Guidance:**
The stage after securing EJU scores, that is, preparing for individual university entrance exams and interviews, is also at the core of the curriculum. Top-tier universities such as the University of Tokyo, Waseda University, and Keio University require essay writing (小論文), in-depth interviews, and portfolio submissions in addition to EJU scores. The school operates small-group coaching tailored to the requirements of these individual universities. Essay guidance focuses on correcting the student's logical development method and style with the help of specialized instructors, while interview preparation is conducted through role-playing and video feedback based on expected questions from university faculty. In particular, it focuses on cultivating the ability to write and present high-level academic plans (研究計画書) required for those wishing to advance in medicine/pharmacy/engineering fields.

**3. Strict Academic Management System:**
Waseda EDU is famous for its very strict attendance and grade management. Under the philosophy that a consistent learning attitude is essential to achieving high academic goals, strong sanctions are imposed for unauthorized absences or lateness. Based on regular level tests and mock exam scores, students are placed in upper-level classes or special classes for target universities, and students with poor grades are provided with mandatory Extra Study Sessions to minimize learning gaps. This close management creates an environment where students do not become lax and can concentrate on their studies.

| University Preparatory Course 1 | April (Spring) | 2 years (24 months) | 1,450,000 | Comprehensive course from EJU/JLPT N1 basics to preparation for entrance exams for top-tier universities. Electives available for advanced science/humanities courses. |
| University Preparatory Course 2 | July (Summer) | 1 year 9 months (21 months) | 1,277,500 | For students with intermediate Japanese or higher. Adjustment of the start time for intensive EJU preparation. High-intensity learning using the summer vacation period. |
| University Preparatory Course 3 | October (Autumn) | 1 year 6 months (18 months) | 1,105,000 | Requires intermediate Japanese proficiency or higher. Compressed course that starts preparing for the EJU and university applications within one year. |
| University Preparatory Course 4 | January (Winter) | 1 year 3 months (15 months) | 932,500 | Short-term intensive course. Suitable for students who already have a solid foundation in Japanese or have experience with university entrance exams in Korea or other overseas countries. |

## Student Body & Campus Life

Waseda EDU Japanese Language School accepts students of very diverse nationalities based on its large capacity (960 students), but due to the school's characteristic of having clear admission goals, students from East Asian countries, especially Korea, China, and Vietnam, account for an overwhelming proportion. These countries have a high enthusiasm for advancing to prestigious Japanese universities and a quick understanding of the EJU system, so they fit well with the school's academic atmosphere. Recently, the number of students from other Asian countries such as Indonesia and Taiwan has been increasing, but the core group that produces admission results is still students from countries with intense entrance exam competition.

The campus life is characterized by being more academically focused and intense than other Japanese language schools. Taking advantage of its geographical advantage in Shinjuku, students can easily use nearby libraries or study rooms even after school, and the school also has ample space for students to study autonomously. Because students have very strong learning motivations, they naturally form study groups, compete, and tend to maximize their academic performance. Extracurricular activities such as cultural exchange activities and community service activities are not completely absent, but their importance is lower compared to university preparation. This is because the school intends to have students use their time as efficiently as possible and focus solely on entrance exam results.

The school has a systematized administrative system to manage 960 large students, and assigns staff in charge for each student's nationality to support visa renewal, insurance processing, and handling of daily life complaints quickly. However, because the atmosphere revolves around academics, it may feel somewhat burdensome or rigid for students who prioritize experiencing Japanese culture or leisurely exchange. Most of Waseda EDU's students have a clear sense of purpose regarding their future careers, and campus life serves as a training ground for achieving these goals. The school regularly holds university entrance exam briefings and invites successful seniors to share their experiences, providing students with continuous motivation and practical advice.

## University & Career Pathways

Waseda EDU Japanese Language School boasts outstanding admission results to top-tier national, public, and private universities in Japan, befitting its title of 'admission specialist.' The school meticulously analyzes each student's EJU scores, academic performance, and desired career path to design the most realistic and successful admission roadmap. This process goes beyond simply providing information and is closer to strategic mentoring for successful admission.

**1. Strategic Admission Counseling and Guidance:**
Students receive regular 1:1 counseling from their homeroom teachers and specialized career counselors from the beginning of enrollment. The content of the counseling focuses on EJU subject selection, setting target university groups, and determining learning priorities according to the admission period. In particular, students in science fields receive information specialized in universities with strengths in STEM fields, such as the Tokyo Institute of Technology (now Tokyo University of Science), Osaka University, and Tohoku University. Students in humanities fields aim for admission to the faculties of literature, economics, and law at top-tier private and national universities such as Waseda, Keio, and Hitotsubashi.

**2. Specialization in Essay and Research Plan Writing:**
Top-tier universities in Japan evaluate students' academic depth through essays and research plans even in special admission programs for international students. Waseda EDU has a strong competitive edge in this area. Experienced professional teachers thoroughly correct and guide students' logical structure, use of academic terminology, and topic suitability. For students wishing to advance to graduate school (partially included in the university preparatory course), it focuses on teaching methods for contacting the supervising professor in advance (appointing), setting research topics, and intensively educating on oral presentation skills to increase the success rate of advancing to master's and doctoral courses.

**3. Prompt Provision and Utilization of Admission Information:**
The school quickly collects and analyzes the latest Japanese university admission trends and changes in admission procedures for each university and provides students with customized information. It invites university officials every year to hold university information sessions within the school and uses the database of successful applicants to precisely analyze the cut-off scores and admission strategies of each university and convey them to the students. This data-based admission guidance plays a crucial role in increasing the accuracy of students' selection of supporting universities.

**4. Career Support After Graduation:**
The main goal is university admission, but basic orientations on Japanese corporate culture and job preparation processes are also provided for students who are considering finding employment in Japan after graduating from university. Many students who graduate from Waseda EDU advance to prestigious Japanese universities and then grow into competitive human resources in the local job market.

## Accommodation & Living Support

To accommodate a large number of 960 students, Waseda EDU Japanese Language School has partnerships with numerous specialized dormitory operators in addition to its own dormitory, providing a wide range of accommodation options. Because residential costs are high near the Ichigaya campus in Shinjuku, it actively utilizes affiliated dormitories in the outer areas of Tokyo, taking commuting time into consideration.

**1. Affiliated Dormitory Options:**
Most of the affiliated dormitories are located in areas that have been verified for safety and cleanliness and are within approximately 30 to 60 minutes by public transportation to the school. Typical options include:

*   **Student Mansion:** Provides private rooms (single rooms), and many have private bathrooms and kitchens, making them suitable for students who prefer independent living.
*   **Shared Dormitory:** Operated in the form of 2-person or 4-person rooms, and the cost burden is relatively low because communal kitchens and laundry facilities are used. It is popular with students who want to improve their Japanese language skills in daily life through exchange with students of various nationalities.
*   **Initial Settlement Support Option:** Short-term accommodation is also available for students to temporarily reside in for a few months immediately after enrollment, helping them to focus on their studies while finding long-term housing.

**2. Initial Settlement Support Services:**
As a school that manages a large number of international students, the initial settlement support system is very systematic. This includes the following essential services:

*   **Airport Pick-up Service:** Supports transportation from the designated airport to the school or dormitory on the day of arrival.
*   **Administrative Procedure Support:** School staff directly guide or accompany students to support essential initial administrative procedures for living in Japan, such as residence registration (resident registration), national health insurance enrollment, and opening post office and bank accounts.
*   **Life Orientation:** Provides detailed information on information necessary for daily life, such as Japanese transportation, recycling rules, and emergency response methods, to help students adapt safely.

**3. Providing Information on Part-Time Jobs and Housing:**
The school strictly guides compliance with the part-time job regulations for student visa holders and operates a job posting board or provides related information so that students can legally find part-time jobs within the limits of not interfering with their studies. In addition, it provides advice on real estate contracts and Japanese housing culture in preparation for moving out on their own after dormitory life.

## Tuition, Fees & Scholarships

The tuition fee for Waseda EDU Japanese Language School is set at a reasonable level, considering that it is an excellent university preparatory school in the Shinjuku area. The total payment includes the entrance fee, tuition fee, facility fee, and textbook fee, and the total amount varies depending on the enrollment period because the study period differs.

**1. Analysis of Total Costs by Course (JPY, Estimated as of 2024):**
The total payment presented is likely to be the total cost for the entire period of the course, not the cost for the first year. (If it is the cost for the first year, it is very expensive compared to general Japanese language schools, so we will analyze it here as the total cost for the total period.)

| Course Name | Duration | Admission Month | Total Fees (JPY) | Average Monthly Cost (Approx.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| University Preparatory Course 1 | 24 months (2 years) | April | 1,450,000 | Approx. 60,417 JPY |
| University Preparatory Course 2 | 21 months (1 year 9 months) | July | 1,277,500 | Approx. 60,833 JPY |
| University Preparatory Course 3 | 18 months (1 year 6 months) | October | 1,105,000 | Approx. 61,389 JPY |
| University Preparatory Course 4 | 15 months (1 year 3 months) | January | 932,500 | Approx. 62,167 JPY |

*Note: The above total payment includes tuition fees, entrance fees, facility maintenance fees, initial textbook fees, etc., and the exact details must be confirmed through the school's official admission guidelines. Due to the nature of the university preparatory course, additional EJU subject supplementary lesson fees may be included compared to general conversation courses.

**2. Scholarship System:**
As a university preparatory school, Waseda EDU actively utilizes various internal and external scholarship systems to encourage students' academic motivation and reduce their financial burden. The main types of scholarships are as follows:

*   **Academic Excellence Scholarship:** Operated by the school itself, it is paid to top students by comprehensively evaluating the EJU mock exam scores, JLPT acquisition status, and attendance rate every semester. This scholarship is mainly provided in the form of tuition fee reduction for the next semester, inducing students' learning competition.
*   **Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) Scholarship for Privately Financed International Students:** This is the most common public scholarship that can be received at Japanese language schools. A fixed monthly amount (usually 48,000 JPY) is paid to students who pass strict screening criteria (attendance rate of 90% or higher, excellent grades, economic need, etc.). Waseda EDU actively provides administrative support so that students who maintain high grades and attendance rates can receive this scholarship.
*   **University Admission Scholarship:** A reward scholarship may be operated internally for students who graduate from Waseda EDU and pass specific prestigious universities (e.g., University of Tokyo, Waseda University, etc.). This contributes to improving the school's admission performance and boosting students' morale.

**3. Other Notes:**
In addition to the total payment, dormitory fees (40,000 JPY to 70,000 JPY per month), living expenses, and transportation expenses will be incurred. In particular, the Shinjuku area is one of the most expensive areas in Tokyo, so this should be fully considered when planning your budget. The school allows students to cover living expenses through part-time jobs, but strictly manages compliance with time regulations to avoid interfering with their studies. It is important to recognize that choosing Waseda EDU is purchasing value beyond cost, that is, the highest level of university preparatory education.
