## EJU vs JLPT: Which one do I need?

So, you're planning to study or work in Japan? Excellent choice! Japan offers incredible opportunities for international students and professionals. But before you pack your bags, you need to navigate the world of Japanese language proficiency exams. Two of the most common are the EJU and the JLPT. Understanding the difference between these exams is crucial for achieving your goals. Let's break it down.

### Key Point 1: EJU - Your Gateway to Japanese Universities

The **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)** is primarily designed for students seeking undergraduate admission to Japanese universities. Think of it as the Japanese equivalent of the SAT or ACT, but with a strong focus on Japanese language proficiency and academic skills.

**Who needs the EJU?**

- **Aspiring University Students:** If your goal is to enroll in a bachelor's degree program at a Japanese university, the EJU is almost certainly required.
- **Government Scholarship Applicants (MEXT):** Applying for a Japanese government scholarship (MEXT) often involves EJU scores.

**What does the EJU test?**

The EJU typically includes the following subjects (depending on the program you're applying to):

- **Japanese as a Foreign Language:** Assesses your reading, writing, listening, and comprehension skills in Japanese.
- **Mathematics:** Either Course 1 (basic math) or Course 2 (more advanced math), depending on the field of study. Science and engineering students usually need Course 2.
- **Science:** Choose two out of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. This is also dependent on your intended major.
- **Japan and the World:** A general knowledge exam about Japanese history, geography, society, and current affairs, along with global issues. This subject is often used for humanities and social science programs.

**EJU Schedule:** The EJU is typically held twice a year, in **June** and **November**.

### Key Point 2: JLPT - Demonstrating Your Japanese Language Skills

The **Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)** is a standardized exam that evaluates and certifies Japanese language proficiency for non-native speakers. Unlike the EJU, it's not specifically tied to university admissions.

**Who needs the JLPT?**

- **Job Seekers:** Many Japanese companies require a certain JLPT level (usually N2 or N1) to demonstrate your ability to communicate in Japanese.
- **Vocational School Applicants:** Some vocational schools (senmon gakko) may require or recommend the JLPT, especially programs that involve direct interaction with Japanese clients or customers.
- **General Language Learners:** Even if you don't need it for a specific purpose, the JLPT is a great way to track your progress and gain a tangible certification of your language skills.

**What does the JLPT test?**

The JLPT consists of five levels, N5 (the easiest) to N1 (the most difficult). Each level assesses:

- **Language Knowledge (Vocabulary and Grammar):** Your understanding of Japanese vocabulary and grammar rules.
- **Reading:** Your ability to read and comprehend written Japanese.
- **Listening:** Your ability to understand spoken Japanese.

**JLPT Schedule:** The JLPT is held twice a year, in **July** and **December**.

### Key Point 3: Comparing the EJU and JLPT

Let's look at a table to compare the key differences between the EJU and JLPT:

| Feature                | EJU                                          | JLPT                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | University Admission                         | Language Proficiency Certification              |
| **Target Audience**    | Aspiring University Students                 | Anyone learning Japanese                        |
| **Subjects**           | Japanese, Math, Science, Japan and the World | Language Knowledge, Reading, Listening          |
| **Scoring**            | Scaled score per subject                     | Pass/Fail based on score thresholds per section |
| **Frequency**          | Twice a year (June & November)               | Twice a year (July & December)                  |
| **Cost (Approximate)** | ¥7,000 - ¥15,000 (depending on subjects)     | ¥5,500 - ¥7,500 (depending on level)            |

As you can see, the EJU and JLPT serve different purposes and assess different skills. If your primary goal is university admission, the EJU is essential. If you want to demonstrate your general Japanese language proficiency for employment or other purposes, the JLPT is the way to go.

### Key Point 4: Can I prepare for both?

Absolutely! While the exams have different focuses, studying for one can definitely benefit your performance on the other. Improving your overall Japanese language skills will naturally improve your performance on the Japanese language section of the EJU. Similarly, studying the academic vocabulary and reading comprehension strategies required for the EJU will enhance your JLPT performance.

**Consider this approach:**

1. **Identify your primary goal:** University admission or general language proficiency?
2. **Prioritize the relevant exam:** Focus your initial efforts on the exam that aligns with your main goal.
3. **Incorporate aspects of the other exam into your study plan:** For example, if you're preparing for the EJU, practice JLPT-style listening comprehension to improve your overall listening skills.
4. **Allocate sufficient study time:** Both exams require dedicated preparation.

### Summary/Conclusion

Choosing between the EJU and JLPT depends entirely on your goals. For university admission, the EJU is essential. For demonstrating general language proficiency, especially for employment, the JLPT is the better choice. Both exams are valuable and can complement each other in your journey to mastering the Japanese language. Good luck with your studies and your future endeavors in Japan! You got this!
