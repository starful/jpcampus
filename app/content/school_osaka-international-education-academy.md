## School Overview & Philosophy

Osaka International Education Academy is a small to medium-sized Japanese language school located in Osaka, the economic and cultural center of western Japan. With a total capacity of 240 students, the school provides an environment where intensive attention can be given to each student. The school's most prominent features are its 'university progression-focused education' and 'provision of a stable living environment.' These are the core values of the school, and it offers a curriculum optimized for students aiming to enter top-tier universities and vocational schools, which is the main purpose of studying abroad in Japan.

The school is located in Nishikujo, Konohana-ku, Osaka City, near Nishikujo Station, where the JR Osaka Loop Line and Hanshin Namba Line intersect, providing excellent transportation access. It offers easy access to Osaka's city center, Umeda and Namba, as well as neighboring cities such as Kobe and Kyoto, providing geographical advantages that allow students to experience Japanese life extensively outside of academics. In particular, the Konohana-ku area, where the school is located, is a vibrant area close to Universal Studios Japan (USJ), but the environment around the school offers a perfect balance for concentrating on studies.

The educational philosophy of Osaka International Education Academy goes beyond simply improving Japanese language skills; it aims to comprehensively acquire 'language, culture, and way of thinking' so that students can successfully continue their studies or build a career in Japanese society. To this end, the school operates a strict attendance management system, as well as practical support systems such as preparation for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) and preparation courses for graduate school entrance examinations. The small to medium size of the school allows for close communication between teachers and students, which is an important factor in providing psychological stability, especially for students who are adapting to life abroad for the first time. This academy aims to serve as a solid foundation that helps international students steadily move towards their dreams, even in unfamiliar environments.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at Osaka International Education Academy is flexibly designed to consider the diverse admission periods and academic goals of students. The core courses are divided into the 'General 2-Year Course' and the 'General 1-Year Course,' which are regular long-term courses, and students are assigned to a customized level based on their Japanese language proficiency at the time of entry into Japan. In particular, since this school prioritizes university progression as its primary goal, the proportion of EJU and university entrance exam preparation classes becomes very high in the intermediate level and above. Classes do not simply focus on delivering language knowledge, but also focus on intensively training academic writing and presentation skills required by Japanese universities.

**Curriculum Structure (Progression Focused):**

*   **Basic/Beginner Level:** Complete mastery of Hiragana/Katakana and basic grammar. Achieve daily conversation skills and JLPT N5~N4 level. Strict pronunciation correction and basic listening training. Induce rapid level-up through 20 hours of intensive classes per week.
*   **Intermediate Level:** Aim for JLPT N3~N2. Improve to the level where you can understand and discuss current affairs such as newspaper articles and TV news. Intensive strengthening of reading and listening comprehension skills for EJU Japanese subject preparation. Start teaching academic sentence writing.
*   **Advanced/Progression Level:** Aim for JLPT N1 and focus on preparing for the actual university entrance exams. Organize special lectures for EJU comprehensive subjects (mathematics, science, comprehensive subjects) and provide customized progression guidance. Thoroughly prepare all the elements required for Japanese university entrance exams through intensive training in interviews and essays (小論文).

**Teaching Style:**
The school provides customized feedback by identifying students' individual learning speeds and weaknesses, focusing on an experienced full-time faculty. In particular, the EJU subject faculty is well-versed in Japanese university entrance exam trends and focuses on enhancing practical skills based on the analysis of the latest past questions. The classroom atmosphere encourages free questions and discussions even in strictness, creating an environment where students of various nationalities cooperate and learn together. Students are managed so that they can accurately grasp their own position and receive motivation through regular mock exams and academic performance evaluations.

## Student Body & Campus Life

Osaka International Education Academy has a very multinational student body due to the characteristics of Osaka as an international city. The main student composition is from various Asian countries such as Korea, China, Vietnam, Nepal, Europe, and North America, and this multicultural environment contributes to students broadening their international perspectives and increasing their understanding of various cultures from within the classroom. Since it is a small to medium-sized school, the focus is more on academic and progression guidance than on student council or club activities, but the school helps students adapt to Japanese life through regular cultural experiences and exchange activities.

**Campus Life Support Elements:**

*   **Cultural Experience Activities:** Regularly conducts Japanese traditional cultural experiences (tea ceremony, kimono experience, participation in local festivals), sightseeing in Osaka and nearby areas (Nara, Kyoto), and seasonal events (Hanami, autumn foliage viewing) to encourage students to experience Japanese society and culture directly.
*   **Living Orientation:** In the early stages of enrollment, detailed information on essential information for living in Japan, such as the medical system, opening bank accounts, part-time job regulations, and garbage separation, is provided to support international students to settle in without confusion. In particular, it also helps with a basic understanding of the unique dialect of the Osaka area (Kansai-ben).
*   **Community Connection:** The Nishikujo area, where the school is located, is well-equipped with convenient living facilities (supermarkets, convenience stores, hospitals, etc.), allowing students to conveniently commute to school and live their daily lives. Nishikujo Station is a major transfer station, providing favorable conditions for traveling to find part-time jobs.

The school manages attendance rates very importantly, not only academic performance, as this is an important evaluation factor when extending student visas and progressing to higher-level schools. The homeroom teacher system plays a mentor role in the overall academic and life of students, and the system is in place to enable immediate consultation and support when problems occur.

## University & Career Pathways

One of the strongest advantages of Osaka International Education Academy is its 'customized progression guidance.' The school provides a detailed progression support system from A to Z tailored to students' individual goals (national/public/private universities, graduate schools, vocational schools, etc.). In particular, support for acquiring high scores on the EJU is systematically provided.

**Details of the progression support system:**

*   **Intensive EJU and JLPT preparation classes:** Optional special lectures are opened after school or on weekends, providing additional learning opportunities for acquiring high scores on the EJU's essential subjects (Japanese, comprehensive subjects, mathematics, science) and JLPT. In particular, preparation for EJU comprehensive subjects is the core of Japanese university entrance exams, so experts in this field are brought in to combine systematic theory learning and problem-solving.
*   **Individual counseling and roadmap construction:** From the beginning of enrollment, the homeroom teacher conducts 1:1 career counseling with students to set target universities and jointly establish a specific learning plan (roadmap) to achieve that goal. Information on optimal university selection and department information according to desired career paths is also provided.
*   **Preparation for university entrance exams and interviews:** Prestigious Japanese universities place importance on university-specific entrance exams (essays) and interviews in addition to EJU scores. The school intensively teaches essay writing methods and repeatedly conducts mock interviews assuming actual university entrance exam situations to build confidence in students so that they are not embarrassed in actual practice. Provides in-depth analysis information on the characteristics and question types of Japanese university interviewers.
*   **Graduate School Progression Support:** For students who wish to go on to graduate school, we provide guidance on how to write research plans (研究計画書), how to contact supervising professors, and advanced Japanese language proficiency training specialized for graduate school entrance exam interviews.

**Main Progression Results (Estimated Based on General Osaka Area School Results):**
The school consistently produces results in progressing to top universities in the Tokyo area, including major national and private universities in the Kansai area (Osaka University, Kobe University, Kyoto University, Ritsumeikan University, Kansai University, Doshisha University, etc.). These achievements are evidence that the school invests intensive educational resources in students with university progression goals.

**Scholarship System:**
Osaka International Education Academy operates various scholarship systems to encourage students with excellent grades and exemplary attendance. We alleviate the financial burden on students and create an environment where they can concentrate on their studies through the Japanese government (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) scholarship recommendation system and the school's own scholarship system. High attendance rates (95% or higher) and excellent academic performance are essential for receiving scholarships.

## Accommodation & Living Support

One of the main strengths of Osaka International Education Academy is that it provides dormitory options to help international students settle in during their initial stages. In order to minimize the burden of housing problems and initial settlement costs, which are the first difficulties experienced by international students arriving in Japan, the school operates affiliated dormitories or its own dormitories. Using the dormitory provides great psychological stability, especially for students who are not familiar with the Japanese language and environment immediately after entering the country.

**Benefits of providing dormitories:**

*   **Safety and convenience:** Located close to the school or in a convenient transportation hub for commuting to school, ensuring a safe and convenient study abroad life. Since it is carefully selected and managed by the school, initial security deposits and other costs are often lower than general rental housing.
*   **Initial Settlement Support:** Basic facilities necessary for living, such as furniture and home appliances, are provided, reducing the initial cost burden for students to purchase household goods separately.
*   **International Exchange Environment:** Living with students of various nationalities in the dormitory becomes a place for exchange where you can naturally learn Japanese and international sense.

**Main Accommodation Options (General Standard):**

| Type                  | Features                                                                                                                                                                                   | Estimated Monthly Rent Range (Including Utilities) | Other Costs                                         |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **School Designated Dormitory** | Single or twin room options, shared facilities (kitchen, laundry), excellent convenience for commuting to school.                                                                                     | ¥30,000 ~ ¥55,000                                  | Security deposit, facility maintenance fee (once upon check-in) |
| **Private Partner Mansion** | General studio apartment type, suitable for students who prefer independent living.                                                                                                         | ¥45,000 ~ ¥70,000                                  | Shikikin/Reikin (security deposit/key money) may be required. |

Dormitories are often closed on a first-come, first-served basis when applying for admission, so it is important to apply as soon as admission is decided. In addition to dormitories, the school helps students live stable housing lives by providing support for the guarantor system required when renting housing and providing local real estate information. Operates an emergency contact network that can be contacted in the event of an emergency to provide 24-hour life support services.
