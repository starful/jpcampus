## 🏫 University Overview

Yokohama National University (YNU), or Yokohama Kokudai, was established in 1949 through the amalgamation of several existing educational institutions in Yokohama, including the Yokohama College of Economics, the Yokohama Technical College, the Yokohama Normal School, and the Kanagawa Normal School for Youth. This merger created a comprehensive university aimed at contributing to the reconstruction of post-war Japan and fostering global perspectives. YNU has since grown into a prominent national university known for its strong emphasis on practical learning and international collaboration.

YNU has a solid reputation, especially in the fields of engineering, economics, and business administration. Its commitment to practical application is reflected in its curriculum, which emphasizes research projects, internships, and collaborations with industry partners. The university is actively involved in international exchange programs, attracting students and researchers from around the world. YNU is dedicated to fostering future leaders who can contribute to solving global challenges.

The university is located in Yokohama, a vibrant port city with a rich history and diverse culture. This location provides students with a unique learning environment, combining academic rigor with urban accessibility. The campus itself is designed to promote interdisciplinary interaction and a sense of community among students and faculty.
