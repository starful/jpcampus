## University Overview & Reputation

Established in 1956, but with roots tracing back to the Chukyo Commercial School in 1923, Chukyo University is a prominent private institution in Nagoya, the industrial and commercial center of Japan's Tokai region. While not as nationally recognized as the Kanto-based mega-universities (often referred to as "Soukeisen" rivals), Chukyo is highly regarded regionally. It is often grouped within the 'Meichuunan' consortium (alongside Meijo and Nanzan Universities) as one of the most prestigious private institutions in central Japan. This reputation stems from a strong dedication to practical, career-focused education, aiming to develop well-rounded individuals prepared for professional life in industries concentrated in the Chubu area, especially manufacturing, finance, and advanced technology. The university maintains a selective admissions process, placing it firmly in the top tier of private universities outside the Tokyo-Osaka corridor.

The university's founding philosophy centers on the motto "Pursue Truth and Cultivate Humanity," emphasizing both rigorous academic inquiry and the development of moral character, civic responsibility, and resilience. Chukyo excels in Sports Science (producing numerous Olympic and international athletes), Psychology, and Business Administration, frequently graduating influential business leaders who contribute to the regional economy. Its strong, long-standing ties to local industries ensure exceptionally high graduate employment rates, making it a reliable and desirable choice for students seeking stable, successful careers after graduation in one of Japan's most dynamic economic zones. Academically, Chukyo is known for its modern, interdisciplinary approach, continuously adapting its curricula to meet the evolving demands of the global workplace.

Chukyo is unique in its blend of academic tradition and cutting-edge modernity, spread across two main campuses. The Yagoto campus in Nagoya is a vertically integrated, urban hub for commerce, humanities, and social sciences. The Toyota Campus specializes in globally leading Sports Science and advanced Engineering facilities. The university has invested significantly in modernizing its infrastructure and expanding its global reach through academic partnerships. For international students, Chukyo offers an excellent opportunity to experience high-quality Japanese higher education outside the high-pressure environments of the Kanto or Kansai regions, offering a unique blend of regional industrial importance, cosmopolitan living in Nagoya, and a supportive academic environment.

## International Student Admissions & Life

### Admissions Process

International undergraduate students at Chukyo University typically follow the General International Student Entrance Examination or a Specialized Examination for overseas applicants. The main path requires candidates to have taken the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**. Required subjects usually include Japanese language (with a high score), Mathematics (Course 1 or 2, depending on the faculty), and either Japan and the World (for humanities) or two Science subjects (for STEM faculties). High proficiency in Japanese, equivalent to JLPT N1 or a high N2 score, is crucial for success in the EJU and coursework.

After successful EJU results, applicants must submit an institutional application, including academic transcripts, a statement of purpose, and proof of financial stability. Most faculties, especially Law, Business, Psychology, and Global Studies, require an on-campus or online **interview**. This interview assesses Japanese comprehension and fluency, as well as the applicant's motivation, critical thinking, and interest in the chosen field. While standardized English proficiency tests like **TOEFL or IELTS** are not the primary entry requirement for Japanese-taught degrees, high scores demonstrate academic readiness and can aid placement in English-medium courses. Admission cycles usually run in the fall (September/October) for April entry, requiring careful scheduling of the EJU examination.

### English-Taught Programs

Chukyo University offers few full degree programs taught entirely in English at the undergraduate level. Its academic offerings are mainly in Japanese, requiring substantial language competency. The university operates under the Japanese educational model, prioritizing linguistic immersion.

However, international students can benefit from **English Track Courses** and bilingual modules within faculties like the **Faculty of Global Studies** and the **Faculty of Business Administration**. These are not full degrees in English, but specialized pathways where a significant portion (30-50%) of core coursework is in English, often using international textbooks and sources. These tracks are for students with strong foundational Japanese skills who wish to specialize using global frameworks and terminology. At the postgraduate level, some research laboratories and fields within Engineering and Information Sciences may conduct thesis supervision and research meetings in English, depending on the professor's research area and partnerships.

### Student Support

The **International Center** at Chukyo University provides non-academic and welfare support for international students. This office offers guidance on student visa renewal, registration with Nagoya authorities, and securing housing (including dormitories and referrals to apartment agencies). Academically, each student is assigned a faculty advisor for course registration, academic planning, and career guidance. The university also offers Japanese language courses to improve academic proficiency, ensuring long-term success. Furthermore, Chukyo provides counseling services, offering mental health support, adjustment counseling, and cross-cultural mentoring.

### Campus Life & Diversity

Chukyo University has a moderately diverse student body, reflecting Nagoya's international outlook. While the number of international students is smaller than at Japan's largest public universities, the cohort (approximately 400-500 students) creates a vibrant community. The university encourages participation in student life, with hundreds of clubs (circles) ranging from traditional arts to sports, academic groups, and international exchange clubs. The Yagoto campus is energetic, sophisticated, and professional, located in a commercial and residential area of Nagoya. The university's regional identity means that international students receive an authentic immersion experience, balancing academic rigor with exposure to the culture and industrial landscape of the Chubu region.
