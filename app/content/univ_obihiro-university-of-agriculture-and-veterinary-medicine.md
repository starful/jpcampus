## 🏫 University Overview

The Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine (OUAVM), known in Japanese as 'Obichiku,' is a prestigious national university located in the heart of Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island. Founded in 1941, it holds a unique position as the only national university in Japan solely dedicated to agriculture, animal science, and veterinary medicine. Its mission is centered on the 'Spirit of Practical Learning,' aiming to produce professionals who can solve global challenges related to food security, animal health, and environmental sustainability.

The university is situated in Obihiro, within the Tokachi Plain, an area often referred to as 'Japan’s Food Basket.' This location is not merely a setting but an integral part of the educational experience. The Tokachi region accounts for a massive portion of Japan's caloric self-sufficiency, providing students with a massive, real-world 'living laboratory' where they can witness large-scale industrial farming and advanced livestock management firsthand.

## 🎓 Academic Programs and Specialized Departments

OUAVM offers a highly focused academic structure designed to create experts in their respective fields. For international students, the primary entry points are the undergraduate and graduate programs within the School of Agriculture.

### 1. Department of Veterinary Medicine (6-year program)
This is one of the most prestigious and competitive veterinary programs in Japan. OUAVM has established a 'Joint Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine' and a 'Joint Department of Veterinary Medicine' with Hokkaido University. This collaboration allows students to benefit from the resources of two major institutions, providing a curriculum that meets international standards (EAEVE accreditation). Students focus on clinical veterinary medicine, public health, and infectious disease control. The program is rigorous, preparing students for the National Veterinary Board Exam and careers in advanced medical research or clinical practice.

### 2. Department of Animal Science and Agriculture (4-year program)
This department is broader in scope and divided into specialized units that allow students to tailor their education:
- **Animal Science:** Focuses on livestock production, animal nutrition, and physiology.
- **Crop Science and Environmental Agriculture:** Concentrates on sustainable farming, soil science, and plant pathology.
- **Food Science:** Covers the chemistry, microbiology, and processing of food products, emphasizing the safety and quality of the food supply chain.
- **Agricultural Economics:** Analyzes the business side of farming, international trade, and regional development.

### 3. Graduate School of Animal Science and Agriculture
Offering Master’s and Doctoral programs, the graduate school is highly research-oriented. It attracts scholars from across the globe, particularly those interested in tropical medicine, animal infectious diseases, and advanced bio-production. Many courses at the graduate level are available in English to accommodate international researchers.

## 🔬 Research Excellence and Innovation

One of the university's crown jewels is the **National Research Center for Protozoan Diseases (NRCPD)**. This center is an internationally recognized hub for research on infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans (zoonoses). It is designated as an OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) Reference Laboratory and a WHO Collaborating Centre. International students interested in epidemiology, immunology, and vaccine development will find unparalleled research opportunities here.

Additionally, the university operates a massive **University Farm** (approximately 180 hectares) and the **Field Center for Animal Science and Agriculture**. These facilities allow for integrated research where students can track the entire process from soil health to crop harvesting and livestock feeding, embodying the 'Farm to Table' philosophy in a scientific context.

## 🌏 International Student Life and Support

Obihiro University provides a close-knit, supportive environment for international students. Because the university is relatively small (around 1,300 total students), there is a strong sense of community and direct interaction with professors.

- **Housing:** The university offers the 'International House' (dormitory), providing affordable accommodation within walking distance of the campus. These dorms are hubs for cultural exchange.
- **Tutoring System:** Each new international student is typically assigned a 'tutor' (a senior Japanese student) who helps with academic challenges and the logistics of living in Japan, such as bank accounts and health insurance.
- **Scholarships:** In addition to the MEXT scholarship, OUAVM students are eligible for various private foundation grants and the JASSO scholarship. The university also offers tuition waivers for high-achieving students facing financial hardship.

## ❄️ Living in Obihiro: The Hokkaido Experience

Living in Obihiro offers a vastly different experience compared to the crowded streets of Tokyo or Osaka. It is a city of wide-open spaces, clean air, and stunning natural beauty.

- **Climate:** Students must be prepared for long, cold winters. However, Obihiro is famous for its 'Tokachi Blue' sky—clear, sunny days even in mid-winter. The city is a gateway to the Daisetsuzan National Park, offering world-class skiing, snowboarding, and hiking.
- **Cuisine:** Being an agricultural hub, the food in Obihiro is exceptional and affordable. It is famous for 'Butadon' (pork bowls), high-quality dairy products, and fresh vegetables.
- **Transportation:** While the city is navigable by bicycle in the summer, most students rely on the bus system or cars during the winter months. The campus is a self-contained community, but the city center is easily accessible for shopping and entertainment.

## 📈 Career Prospects for Graduates

Graduates of OUAVM are highly sought after in Japan and internationally. The university maintains a nearly 100% employment rate for its students. 
- **Veterinary Graduates:** Often move into clinical practice, pharmaceutical companies, or government roles in animal quarantine and public health.
- **Agriculture/Animal Science Graduates:** Frequently find roles in major Japanese food companies (like Meiji or Nippon Ham), agricultural machinery manufacturers, and local government agricultural sectors.
- **International Organizations:** Many doctoral graduates go on to work for the FAO, WHO, or international research NGOs, utilizing the specialized knowledge gained at the NRCPD.

## 📝 Admission Guide for International Students

For undergraduate programs, international students typically apply through the **EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students)**. High proficiency in Japanese (N2 or N1 level) is usually required as most undergraduate lectures are conducted in Japanese. The selection process includes an evaluation of EJU scores, an English proficiency test (TOEIC/TOEFL), and an interview.

For graduate programs, the process is more research-focused. Prospective students are strongly encouraged to contact a potential supervisor (Professor) whose research aligns with their interests before applying. This 'pre-matching' is a critical step in the Japanese graduate school application process. Some graduate programs offer an English-based track, reducing the Japanese language barrier for researchers.

## 💡 Conclusion

Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine is a specialized powerhouse. It is not the right choice for someone seeking a generic liberal arts education in a metropolis. However, for a student dedicated to the sciences of life, food, and animals, it offers an education that is deeply rooted in the land and globally relevant in its research impact. By choosing OUAVM, you are joining a legacy of specialists dedicated to feeding the world and protecting the health of all living creatures.
