## Student Body & Campus Life

Based on the provided data, the school has a capacity of 80 students. However, the metadata indicates that there are currently *0 international students*. This suggests that the program is either relatively new, in a period of restructuring, or primarily serves domestic students. Should the international student population increase, the school would ideally aim for diversity. A balanced nationality mix enhances the learning experience by fostering cross-cultural understanding and broadening perspectives. Ideally, no single nationality should dominate the student body. A healthy mix might include students from various Asian countries (China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia), as well as students from Europe, North America, and South America.

While specific details about campus facilities are not provided, it is reasonable to assume that the school offers standard amenities such as classrooms, a library or study area, a computer lab with internet access, and a student lounge. Given the school's focus on university preparation, the library would likely contain a collection of EJU preparation materials, university entrance exam past papers, and resources on Japanese higher education. The computer lab would provide students with access to online learning platforms and research databases.

Information on extracurricular activities is also limited. However, it is likely that the school organizes a range of activities to promote cultural exchange, build community, and enhance students' overall well-being. These activities might include:

*   **Volunteer activities:** Community service projects, such as cleaning up local parks or assisting at local festivals.
*   **University visits:** Organized trips to nearby universities to explore campus facilities and meet with faculty and students.

The school's relatively small size would likely contribute to a close-knit and supportive campus environment. Students would have ample opportunities to interact with their teachers and classmates, forming strong bonds and creating a sense of belonging. The school staff would likely be readily available to provide assistance and guidance to students, fostering a caring and nurturing atmosphere.
