## University Overview

Tokyo Metropolitan University (TMU) is a leading public university in Japan, dedicated to serving the needs of Tokyo while maintaining a global perspective in research and education. Established in 2005 through the merger of three Tokyo-administered institutions, TMU has a history spanning over 70 years and a comprehensive academic profile. It is known for its excellence in both humanities and technology, particularly its focus on urban studies, environmental science, and systems design.

The main campus is in Minami-Osawa, Hachioji, offering a modern, spacious environment. While removed from central Tokyo, the campus has excellent facilities, including advanced laboratories and extensive library resources. TMU's mission is to generate knowledge that benefits society, foster ethical leaders, and contribute to community development. As a publicly funded institution, TMU offers top-tier education at lower costs compared to private or national universities, making it attractive for international students.

TMU’s advantage lies in its multidisciplinary approach, encouraging cross-faculty collaboration to address modern issues like sustainability and digital transformation. Its faculty members are leaders in their fields. For international students, choosing TMU means immersing oneself in an environment where research informs policy and innovation. However, the core undergraduate curriculum is primarily taught in Japanese, requiring strong proficiency (N1 level).

The university operates several campuses, including the Hino Campus (Systems Design), the Arakawa Campus (Health Sciences), and the Harumi Campus (extension education). This allows specialized disciplines to thrive. TMU graduates enjoy high employment rates in major Japanese corporations and public sector roles, cementing TMU’s status as a pipeline for high-level talent.

#### Other Mandatory Expenses

Beyond tuition, students must budget for the following estimated annual expenses:

*   **Insurance/Health:** Approximately ¥30,000 (National Health Insurance is mandatory).
*   **Textbooks/Materials:** Approximately ¥50,000 - ¥100,000 (Varies by major).
*   **Dormitory Fees (If applicable):** ¥30,000 - ¥50,000 per month.
*   **Cost of Living (Excluding Housing):** ¥80,000 - ¥120,000 per month for food, utilities, transportation, and personal expenses.

#### Opportunities for Work

International students are permitted to work up to 28 hours per week after obtaining permission. Part-time work can help cover living expenses, though students should focus on their studies.

TMU represents a superb investment in higher education. Its public status ensures affordability, while its research excellence guarantees a world-class academic experience. The fee waiver system and available scholarships can reduce the overall educational cost.
