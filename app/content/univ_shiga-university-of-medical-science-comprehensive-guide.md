## 🏫 University Overview

Shiga University of Medical Science (SUMS), or Shiga Ika Daigaku, stands as a premier national medical institution in Japan. Founded in 1974, it was established during a period of rapid modernization in Japanese medical education to address the need for high-level medical practitioners and researchers in the Kansai region. Located in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, the university overlooks the beautiful Lake Biwa, providing a serene environment conducive to the rigorous demands of medical study. 

As a single-faculty university specializing exclusively in medicine and nursing, SUMS offers an incredibly focused academic environment. This specialization allows for a high faculty-to-student ratio and a deep sense of community. The university's mission is rooted in the pursuit of 'Truth, Goodness, and Beauty' within the medical field, aiming to cultivate doctors and nurses who possess not only advanced technical skills but also profound humanity and ethical standards.

## 🎓 Academic Departments and Specializations

### School of Medicine
The 6-year undergraduate medical program is the cornerstone of the university. The curriculum is designed to evolve from basic sciences to clinical practice seamlessly. 
- **Pre-clinical Years (1-2):** Students focus on liberal arts, basic biology, chemistry, and introductory medical ethics. There is a strong emphasis on early clinical exposure, where students visit hospitals to understand the patient experience from the start.
- **Basic Medicine (3-4):** Intensive study of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology. This phase includes the 'Student Doctor' assessment (CBT and OSCE) which students must pass to enter clinical clerkships.
- **Clinical Clerkship (5-6):** Students rotate through various departments in the Shiga University of Medical Science Hospital. These rotations cover everything from internal medicine and surgery to pediatrics and psychiatry.

### School of Nursing
The 4-year nursing program is recognized for its high standards and integration with the medical school. It emphasizes 'Science of Nursing,' training students to use evidence-based practices. Graduates are prepared for the National Nursing Examination and many pursue additional qualifications in midwifery or public health nursing.

### Graduate School of Medicine
The graduate school is where most international students are found. It offers:
- **Master’s Program (2 years):** Often in Nursing Science or Medical Sciences for non-medical graduates.
- **Doctoral Program (4 years):** Focused on advanced medical research, leading to a PhD. Research areas include Molecular Neuroscience, Cancer Research, and Cardiovascular Medicine.

## 🔬 Cutting-Edge Research and Facilities

One of the defining features of SUMS is its research prowess, which punch far above its size. 

### Molecular Neuroscience Research Center (MNRC)
This center is a global hub for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's research. It utilizes advanced imaging and molecular biology techniques to understand neurodegenerative diseases. For international students interested in neuroscience, this is one of the top facilities in Asia.

### Research Center for Animal Life Science (RCALS)
SUMS is world-renowned for its research using non-human primates (cynomolgus monkeys). This facility allows for high-level preclinical trials and physiological studies that are impossible in other institutions. This makes SUMS a critical partner for global pharmaceutical companies and research institutes.

### University Hospital
The attached hospital is a 'Functionally-Evaluated Medical Care Hospital,' providing advanced tertiary care. It serves as a laboratory for clinical research and a training ground for students, featuring state-of-the-art robotic surgery suites and advanced diagnostic imaging centers.

## 📝 Admissions Guide for International Students

Admission to SUMS is highly competitive, especially for the undergraduate School of Medicine. 

### Undergraduate Admission (Special Selection for International Students)
1. **EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission):** Applicants must take the EJU. High scores in Japanese as a Foreign Language, Science (Biology, Chemistry), and Mathematics (Course 2) are mandatory. Typically, a Japanese score of 380+ (excluding writing) is expected.
2. **English Proficiency:** Submission of TOEFL iBT or IELTS scores is generally required. While there is no strict cutoff, a TOEFL score above 80 is recommended.
3. **University-Specific Exams:** Shortlisted candidates must travel to Shiga for the university's entrance exam, which includes an essay and a rigorous interview in Japanese. The interview assesses not just academic knowledge but the student's motivation to practice medicine in Japan.

### Graduate Admission
For Master’s and PhD programs, the process involves:
- Finding a prospective supervisor (Sensei) before applying.
- Submitting a research proposal.
- An entrance examination (often including English and a subject-specific test) and an interview.
- Many graduate courses can be conducted in English, but basic Japanese is highly recommended for daily life and clinical interactions.

## 💰 Tuition, Fees, and Financial Support

As a national university, SUMS follows the standard Japanese tuition structure, making it much more affordable than private medical schools or western universities.

- **Admission Fee:** 282,000 JPY (one-time payment).
- **Annual Tuition:** 535,800 JPY (paid in two installments).

**Financial Aid:**
- **Tuition Exemptions:** Students with excellent academic records and financial need can apply for a 50% or 100% tuition waiver.
- **Scholarships:** International students are eligible for the MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship, the JASSO honors scholarship, and various private foundations like the Rotary Yoneyama Memorial Foundation.

## 🏘️ Campus Life and Living in Shiga

### Location: The Best of Both Worlds
The campus is located in Seta, Otsu. While Shiga is considered a 'suburb' of Kyoto, it offers a much lower cost of living and a quieter atmosphere. 
- **Access:** Kyoto Station is only 15-20 minutes away by train (JR Biwako Line). This allows students to enjoy the cultural richness of Kyoto while living in a more affordable area.
- **Lake Biwa:** Japan's largest lake offers recreational activities like cycling, hiking, and water sports, providing a vital mental health break for busy medical students.

### Accommodation
SUMS provides an International Student House (dormitory) located near the campus. These rooms are furnished and very affordable (typically 15,000 to 25,000 JPY per month). Private apartments in the Seta area are also readily available for 40,000 to 60,000 JPY per month.

### Student Support
The International Center provides comprehensive support, including Japanese language classes, help with visa renewals, and 'tutor' systems where Japanese students assist newcomers with their studies and daily life.

## 🚀 Career Opportunities and Alumni Success

Graduating from SUMS opens prestigious doors within the Japanese healthcare system. 

- **Medical Licensure:** The pass rate for the National Medical Practitioners Qualifying Examination at SUMS is consistently high, often exceeding 95%. 
- **Residency:** Graduates are placed in top-tier hospitals across Japan, including the SUMS University Hospital, Kyoto University Hospital, and major centers in Osaka and Tokyo.
- **Global Research:** Many PhD graduates move on to postdoctoral positions at Harvard, Oxford, or the Max Planck Institutes, leveraging the university's international research networks.

## 💡 Expert Tips for Prospective Applicants

1. **Master the Language:** For the School of Medicine, JLPT N1 is practically a prerequisite. Even for graduate students, clinical research requires interacting with patients, so functional Japanese is your greatest asset.
2. **Research the 'Shiga' Factor:** In your interview, explain why you want to study in Shiga specifically. The university takes pride in its 'Community Medicine' (Chiiki Iryo). Expressing an interest in how medical care serves local populations will impress the admissions committee.
3. **Early Contact:** If applying for a PhD, contact professors 6-12 months in advance. Having a professor agree to supervise you is 80% of the battle won.
4. **Prepare for the 'MENS' mindset:** Medicine, Ethics, Nursing, and Science. Show that you are a well-rounded individual, not just a test-taker. Participation in volunteer work or sports can be a significant advantage in the interview phase.
