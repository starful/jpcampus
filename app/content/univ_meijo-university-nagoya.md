## 🌍 International Student Admissions & Life

**Admissions Process:**
The primary admission route for international undergraduate students (私費外国人留学生入試) at Meijo University generally requires candidates to demonstrate a strong academic background and high linguistic competence. The application cycle typically begins in the autumn preceding the enrollment year (April start). The process usually involves:

1.  **Japanese Proficiency & Academic Screening:** The **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)** is mandatory for virtually all undergraduate faculties. Required subjects almost always include Japanese (critical component), Mathematics (Course 1 or 2 depending on the faculty’s technical requirements), and either Japan and the World (for humanities) or Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology - mandatory choices for STEM faculties). Specific score requirements vary yearly, but highly competitive faculties (like Pharmacy or Engineering) demand top-tier scores in both the Japanese language section and relevant technical subjects.
2.  **English Proficiency:** While fluency in Japanese is the main gatekeeper, high scores in standardized English tests (TOEFL iBT or IELTS Academic) are often required or highly recommended, especially for certain departments within the Foreign Studies or Business faculties, proving global competency and eligibility for potential exchange programs.
3.  **Application and Screening:** Submission of academic transcripts from the student's home country, personal essays detailing motivation, and potentially recommendation letters. A critical final component is the **interview (面接)**, which is typically conducted entirely in Japanese and assesses the applicant's dedication, academic readiness, critical thinking skills, and genuine ability to adapt to a Japanese-language academic and social environment. Some specialized humanities programs may include a written exam (小論文) tailored to the intended major.

**English-Taught Programs (Degree Programs):**

International students must enter the university prepared for a Japanese-language learning environment. The university focuses its internationalization efforts on supporting existing students, promoting Japanese language preparatory courses, and facilitating short-term exchange programs.

**Student Support:**
The **International Center (国際センター)** serves as the critical hub for all support services for non-Japanese students navigating life in Japan. Key services provided include:
*   **Visa and Immigration Support:** Comprehensive assistance with the Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) application, smooth visa renewal processes, and liaising with local immigration bureaus on behalf of students.
*   **Academic Advising:** Offering dedicated guidance on course registration, study planning, identifying necessary remedial study, and connecting students struggling with the language barrier or specific course material to specialized tutors or faculty advisors.
*   **Counseling and Mental Health:** Providing culturally sensitive and confidential counseling services, recognizing the unique pressures faced by students adapting to a new country and a demanding academic environment.
*   **Housing Assistance:** While university dormitories are extremely limited and competitive, the center actively aids students in navigating the complex private rental market in Nagoya, providing necessary institutional guarantees (required by landlords) or recommending reputable, student-friendly real estate agents.

**Campus Life & Diversity:**
Meijo University hosts a moderately sized but robust international student population, typically ranging between 400 and 600 students across all campuses and graduate schools.
