## School Overview & Philosophy

UNITAS Japanese Language School, Tokyo Campus, is one of Japan's leading large-scale language schools. It's a prestigious institution operating with a strong educational infrastructure linked to the Kyorin Group (a educational foundation) and Waseda Academy. Its large capacity of 840 students demonstrates the systematic management and rich educational resources the school offers. The school's core philosophy focuses on helping students successfully enter Japanese higher education institutions (universities, graduate schools, vocational schools), going beyond simple language acquisition. To achieve this goal, UNITAS has a curriculum specializing in university preparation and highly skilled professional instructors. The Shin-Okubo area of Shinjuku Ward, where the Tokyo campus is located, boasts Tokyo's most vibrant and international environment. It is adjacent to 'Korea Town,' offering excellent living convenience and an optimal location for quickly adapting to Japanese life while experiencing diverse cultures. This geographical advantage allows students to gain rich experiences outside of academics and helps them transform Tokyo's dynamic energy into academic motivation. The school building itself has modern facilities and secures sufficient classrooms, study rooms, and counseling spaces to accommodate a large number of students, providing a comfortable and highly focused learning environment. UNITAS Tokyo Campus prioritizes fostering international talent and cultivating essential language skills and academic knowledge so students can successfully establish themselves in Japanese society. This is the core of the school's grand vision of 'nurturing global talent.'

UNITAS Tokyo Campus is especially famous for providing an educational system customized for students who wish to pursue higher education. With a long history dating back to 1974 and the know-how accumulated over the years, the school sends many students to prestigious Japanese universities every year. Rather than simply aiming to acquire JLPT N1, it focuses on cultivating the in-depth academic Japanese language skills necessary to secure high scores on university entrance exams and the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission), i.e., logical thinking skills and complex text analysis skills. The school helps students clearly set their academic goals from the time of enrollment and systematically manages the goal achievement process through regular individual interviews and learning progress checks. This dedicated guidance is a major driving force behind UNITAS Tokyo Campus's firmly established reputation as a prestigious university preparation school in the Tokyo area. Students can effectively navigate the complex procedures and requirements of Japanese university entrance exams with the careful guidance of teachers, which is a great benefit, especially for students preparing to study abroad on their own. The school also supports students in growing as members of Japanese society, not just as international students, by conducting special activities and classes that enhance understanding of Japanese culture and society. UNITAS's education program is the most suitable option for students who expect a high level of academic achievement.

## Courses, Curriculum & Teaching Style

The curriculum at UNITAS Japanese Language School, Tokyo Campus, is entirely focused on 'intensive university preparation.' It offers various duration options so students can choose the optimal course based on their individual learning speed and target university path. All courses are assigned through systematic level tests, and after enrollment, level adjustments and learning plan revisions are made through regular academic evaluations and consultations with homeroom teachers. The curriculum starts with basic Japanese language acquisition, and in the intermediate stage, it aims for JLPT N2, fostering conversation and writing skills. In the advanced stage, it focuses on academic skills necessary for writing EJU and graduate school research plans. In particular, separate supplementary classes or special lectures are offered for EJU subjects (comprehensive subjects, mathematics, science), which is a major strength because students can handle the overall subject preparation required for the entrance exam within the school, not just Japanese. This is a professional system rarely found in other general Japanese language schools.

The school's teaching method emphasizes 'balanced four-skills learning (reading, writing, listening, and speaking),' avoids simple grammar-injection education, and aims for communication-centered classes that enhance application in real-life situations. At the advanced level, it intensively trains high-level presentation skills, discussion skills, and academic report writing skills required by Japanese university professors. The faculty consists of Japanese language education experts with many years of experience who provide customized learning feedback considering each student's national learning background and tendencies. In addition, mock interview guidance and small essay (小論文) correction guidance are provided almost infinitely for university preparation students, preparing them thoroughly to be competitive in the actual entrance exam. Through the homeroom teacher system, students can discuss and resolve not only academic concerns but also difficulties in their overall study abroad life with their homeroom teachers, which is a great help in settling down in the early stages of studying abroad. UNITAS Tokyo Campus creates an educational environment that encourages active student participation and helps them form self-directed learning habits, focusing on building the basic strength for students to successfully continue their studies even after entering Japanese universities.

## Student Body & Campus Life

UNITAS Tokyo Campus operates with a large capacity of 840 students, and the nationality ratio of students is very diverse, creating an international environment. In addition to the mainstream East Asian and Southeast Asian students from Korea, China, and Vietnam, students from South Asian countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, and from all over the world, including Europe, North America, and South America, study together, forming a truly global campus atmosphere. This diversity greatly helps students indirectly experience various cultures and broaden their international perspectives in addition to Japanese. Due to the nature of a large school, competition among students can be fierce, but this acts as a positive factor in creating a high academic atmosphere and synergy of mutual learning.

The school regularly operates various cultural experience and exchange programs so students can adapt well to vibrant Tokyo life and relieve academic stress. For example, it provides practical Japanese language usage opportunities outside the classroom through participation in Japanese traditional festivals, nearby trips, Japanese culture classes (tea ceremony, calligraphy, etc.), and local community service activities. In particular, the Shin-Okubo location provides an optimal environment for students to find part-time jobs or enjoy living conveniences after school, and its excellent public transportation access allows them to easily travel anywhere in Tokyo. The school also assists in applying for and managing international students' part-time job permits, providing practical support so they can cover their living expenses in parallel with their studies.

As a large school, the student management system is also systematically established. Professional counselors are stationed to provide advice on visa issues, health problems, psychological difficulties, etc., which are commonly experienced by international students. Student council activities are also active, providing students with opportunities to directly participate in school operations, autonomously plan campus events, and develop leadership. The campus life at UNITAS Tokyo Campus focuses on providing a dynamic and supportive environment that goes beyond simply learning Japanese, cultivating the qualities necessary as future global leaders.

## University & Career Pathways

The greatest strength of UNITAS Tokyo Campus is its unparalleled expertise in university preparation guidance. The school operates EJU and JLPT exam preparation as mandatory curriculum, and separately operates a 'special university preparation class' for students aiming to enter prestigious national, public, and private universities in Japan. In this class, in-depth lectures by specialized instructors are provided on EJU's core subjects: comprehensive subjects (geography, history, politics, economics), mathematics course 1/2, and science (physics, chemistry, biology). These lectures follow the Japanese high school curriculum while focusing on areas that international students find difficult, designed to acquire high scores in a short period.

University preparation counseling is conducted on a 1:1 customized basis, and the optimal entrance exam strategy is established considering the desired major and university level. Teachers provide detailed analysis of each university's application requirements, submission documents (statement of purpose, research plan), and interview and small essay trends based on the latest entrance exam information updated every year. In particular, for students aiming for graduate school, highly advanced correction guidance is provided on how to contact Japanese professors, the structure and logical development of research plans, helping students pass the high competition and enter their desired graduate schools. Analyzing past successful university preparation cases (acceptance portfolios) and providing students with practical benchmarking materials is also a feature of the UNITAS university preparation system.

UNITAS Tokyo Campus invites officials from major universities and vocational schools in the Tokyo area every year to hold on-campus information sessions. Through these information sessions, students have valuable opportunities to obtain various school information and communicate directly with entrance exam officials. In addition, for students who wish to find employment in Japan after graduation, a business Japanese course is offered to enhance their employment competitiveness by educating them on understanding Japanese corporate culture, business manners, and polite language. Students from UNITAS have successfully entered prestigious private universities such as Waseda University, Meiji University, and Ritsumeikan University, as well as prominent vocational schools and graduate schools in the Tokyo area, which is a result that proves the excellence of the UNITAS education system. You can expect the school's full support at every stage for university preparation.

## Accommodation & Living Support

UNITAS Japanese Language School, Tokyo Campus, provides various types of accommodation connection services so that students can settle stably in Tokyo life. Rather than directly operating its own dormitory due to the nature of a large school, it cooperates with reliable external professional dormitory companies or international student-only residences located around the school to introduce students to customized accommodation. This provides students with the flexibility to choose the facility that best suits them (private room, shared room, women-only, etc.) considering commuting distance.

The accommodation options provided are usually located within 30 to 60 minutes by public transportation from the school, and are equipped with basic furniture and home appliances necessary for initial settlement, so students can move in immediately without separate preparation. The school supports or acts on behalf of complex procedures (guarantor issues, initial cost settlement, etc.) that occur when contracting accommodation, minimizing the burden on international students. In particular, although the Okubo area is in the city center, there are relatively diverse price ranges for accommodation, so you can secure accommodation at a reasonable price through the school's cooperation.

In terms of living support, UNITAS Tokyo Campus provides detailed information essential for studying abroad life, such as Tokyo life information, transportation guidance, bank account opening, and mobile phone opening procedures, through an orientation at the beginning of entry. In addition, administrative assistance such as Japanese health insurance enrollment and management, and foreign registration procedures are also provided through dedicated staff. The safety of students is prioritized, and an emergency contact network is operated to contact in case of emergency, and a system is built so that faculty and staff can respond quickly. This comprehensive living support is a strong background that allows students to focus solely on their studies.

## Tuition, Fees & Scholarships

The tuition structure of UNITAS Tokyo Campus follows the standards of a large prestigious language school, and the initial payment includes admission fee, tuition fee, facility fee, and textbook fee. The total tuition fee varies depending on the university preparation course, and generally, the longer the course is registered, the lower the average monthly burden tends to be. The tuition fee is evaluated as very reasonable considering the quality of Japanese language education, the extensive university preparation support services provided, and the excellent location in the center of Tokyo.
