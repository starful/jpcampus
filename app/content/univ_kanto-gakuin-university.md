## 🏫 University Overview

Kanto Gakuin University (KGU) is a prestigious private institution located in the vibrant port city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Founded on the principles of Christian educational values, the university operates under the powerful school motto, "Be a Man, Serve the World." This philosophy emphasizes not only academic excellence but also the development of a strong moral character and a spirit of service to the global community. With a history stretching back to the late 19th century through its predecessor, the Yokohama Baptist Theological Seminary, KGU has evolved into a comprehensive university that bridges tradition with cutting-edge innovation.

Today, Kanto Gakuin University serves as a cornerstone of higher education in the Greater Tokyo Area, hosting over 11,000 students across various undergraduate and graduate programs. For international students, KGU offers a unique blend of high-quality Japanese academic standards and a welcoming, inclusive environment. The university is particularly renowned for its strong focus on practical application, ensuring that students are not just learning theory but are prepared to enter the workforce as skilled professionals.

## 📍 Campus Locations and Environment

One of KGU's most attractive features is its strategic locations across Yokohama, providing students with diverse environments ranging from traditional academic settings to modern urban hubs.

1.  **Kanazawa-Hakkei Campus (Main):** Located in the Kanazawa ward of Yokohama, this campus is the heart of the university. Surrounded by greenery and the sea, it provides a serene atmosphere conducive to deep study and research. It houses most of the traditional faculties and the university’s central administrative offices.
2.  **Kannai Campus (The Urban Hub):** Opened in April 2023, this state-of-the-art campus is situated in the middle of Yokohama's business and government district. Designed as a "social hub," it fosters collaboration between students, local businesses, and government entities. The Faculty of Law and parts of the Business and Economics departments operate here, putting students in direct contact with the professional world.
3.  **Mutsuura Campus:** Primarily home to the Faculty of Science and Engineering, this campus features specialized laboratories and research facilities. It is located near the Kanazawa-Hakkei area, creating a cohesive community of learners in southern Yokohama.

## 🎓 Academic Excellence and Faculties

Kanto Gakuin University offers a wide array of faculties, each designed to meet the demands of the modern global economy:

*   **Faculty of Economics & Business Administration:** These faculties are the powerhouse of the university, focusing on the complexities of global markets, finance, and organizational management. The curriculum is designed to foster entrepreneurial spirit and data-driven decision-making.
*   **Faculty of Law:** Moving to the Kannai Campus has revolutionized this faculty. Students study law in the heart of the judicial district, allowing for unique internships and real-world observations of the Japanese legal system.
*   **Faculty of Science and Engineering:** Unlike many private liberal arts colleges, KGU maintains a strong engineering focus. Programs in Mechanical, Electrical, and Surface Engineering are highly regarded, often involving collaborative research with Japan's leading tech and automotive industries.
*   **Faculty of Architecture and Environmental Design:** KGU’s architecture program is exceptionally popular. It emphasizes sustainable building practices and urban planning, crucial topics in disaster-prone Japan. Students often participate in local redevelopment projects in Yokohama.
*   **Faculty of Intercultural Studies:** This is a primary destination for many international students. It focuses on global communication, sociology, and cultural analysis, preparing students for careers in international NGOs, tourism, and multinational corporations.
*   **Faculty of Nursing and Education:** These professional faculties are dedicated to the welfare and development of Japanese society, offering rigorous training and high certification pass rates.

## 🌏 Support for International Students

Kanto Gakuin University recognizes that moving to a new country is a significant challenge. To assist, the Center for International Exchange (CIE) provides comprehensive support for overseas students. This includes:

*   **Japanese Language Programs:** KGU offers structured Japanese language support ranging from beginner to advanced levels. These courses are designed to help students transition from language learners to professional communicators.
*   **The Global Lounge:** A dedicated space on campus where international and Japanese students can interact, share cultures, and practice language exchange. It serves as a social safety net for newcomers.
*   **Tutoring System:** Senior students often serve as tutors to help international freshmen navigate both academic requirements and the nuances of daily life in Japan, such as opening bank accounts or finding housing.
*   **Scholarships and Financial Aid:** KGU offers its own internal scholarship programs specifically for international students who demonstrate academic merit and financial need. This is in addition to the ability to apply for external scholarships like the JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) grant.

## 🏢 Career Support and Employment Success

One of the university's strongest selling points is its employment record. KGU boasts an employment rate for graduates that consistently exceeds 95%. This success is driven by the Career Support Center, which begins working with students as early as their first or second year. 

For international students, the university provides specialized guidance on the Japanese job-hunting (Shu-katsu) process. This includes workshops on writing Japanese resumes (Rirekisho), mastering business etiquette, and practicing for high-pressure interviews. Given Yokohama’s status as a major economic center, students have access to a vast network of local and international companies for internships and post-graduation employment.

## 🏠 Student Life and Housing

Living in Yokohama offers an unparalleled experience. As Japan’s second-largest city, it is safer and less crowded than Tokyo but offers equally world-class shopping, dining, and entertainment. The university provides an **International Residence** in the Kanazawa-Hakkei area. This dormitory is more than just a place to sleep; it is a multicultural community where international students live alongside Japanese students who act as resident assistants. 

Extracurricular life is vibrant at KGU. There are over 100 student clubs and circles, ranging from competitive sports like rugby and baseball to traditional arts like tea ceremony and calligraphy. Joining these clubs is widely considered the best way for international students to integrate into the local community and build lifelong friendships.

## 📝 Admission Information for International Students

Kanto Gakuin University typically offers two main periods for international admissions, usually in the autumn and winter. The selection process generally involves:

1.  **The EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students):** Most faculties require EJU scores in Japanese as a Foreign Language, along with subject tests depending on the faculty.
2.  **Internal Entrance Examination:** This often includes a written essay (in Japanese) and an interview with faculty members.
3.  **Application Documents:** Students must provide evidence of their previous academic performance, a statement of purpose, and proof of financial support.

Potential applicants are encouraged to visit the campus during Open Campus days or contact the International Admissions office early to understand the specific requirements for their chosen faculty.
