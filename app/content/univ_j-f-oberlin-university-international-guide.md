## University Overview

J.F. Oberlin University (桜美林大学, Ōbirin Daigaku) is a private, multi-campus institution founded on the principle of 'Learning to Serve,' with a strong emphasis on international exchange, practical learning, and Christian values. Primarily located in Machida, a bustling and green suburban area of Tokyo, Oberlin offers a unique combination of accessibility to the metropolitan area and a focused, community-oriented campus environment. The university's structure is defined by its 'Gakugun' (Academic Cluster) system, providing students with exceptional flexibility in designing their academic paths, bridging traditional departmental boundaries, and fostering interdisciplinary competence—a highly sought-after skill in today's global workforce.

Oberlin is strategically positioned to attract students interested in both traditional Japanese-language programs and specialized English-medium options. The institution operates four main campuses:

*   **Machida Campus:** The central campus, home to most undergraduate colleges.
*   **Yotsuya Campus:** Focused on graduate studies and professional schools.
*   **Shinjuku Campus:** A modern facility emphasizing business and global studies.
*   **Tsurukawa Campus:** Dedicated largely to the performing arts.

## Core Philosophy and International Focus

Oberlin’s commitment to internationalization is profound, hosting one of the largest populations of international students among private universities in the Tokyo area, particularly drawing heavily from East Asian nations. This diverse environment creates a robust platform for cultural exchange and global networking. The university mandates global education experiences for many programs, encouraging students to develop a truly global perspective necessary for success in fields ranging from aviation to business management. The institutional support for international students is extensive, covering everything from visa procedures to academic tutoring, making it a viable and welcoming option for non-Japanese residents seeking higher education in Japan.

## Faculties & Departments

J.F. Oberlin University organizes its academic offerings into seven major Colleges (Gakugun), designed to promote intellectual exploration and adaptability. The 'Gakugun' system is distinct in that it often allows students to delay specialization, drawing foundational knowledge from multiple fields before declaring a primary area of focus. International applicants should thoroughly understand the structure of each college, as some require strong Japanese proficiency while others offer specialized tracks in English.

*   **College of Arts and Sciences (Liberal Arts):** This is the university's flagship and most flexible college. Students here engage in a broad curriculum covering humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and information technology. It is ideal for students who possess multiple interests or who are aiming for careers requiring adaptable problem-solving skills, such as international relations, journalism, or public policy. The interdisciplinary approach allows students to combine minors and majors across traditionally separate disciplines.
*   **College of Business Management:** Focused on preparing students for the fast-paced global business environment. Programs cover traditional fields like accounting, finance, marketing, and organizational theory, but with a strong emphasis on global strategy, entrepreneurship, and sustainable business practices. The Shinjuku campus extension supports close collaboration with businesses located in central Tokyo, providing valuable internship and networking opportunities.
*   **College of Global Communication:** This college is dedicated to language acquisition, cultural studies, and effective communication in an interconnected world. It offers intensive studies in English, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese language pedagogy. **Crucially for non-Japanese speakers, this college often houses English-taught tracks, such as the Global Studies Program, designed specifically for students entering without high-level Japanese proficiency (though Japanese language training is still mandatory upon enrollment).**
*   **College of Health and Welfare:** Addressing societal needs in healthcare and social service, this college encompasses departments such as Social Work, Mental Health, and Sports Science. It requires a significant commitment to field work and practical training. Due to the high level of specialized terminology and regulatory knowledge required in Japanese welfare systems, proficiency in the Japanese language (N1 or high N2) is generally essential for admission to these specific tracks.
*   **College of Aviation Management:** One of Oberlin's most unique and highly specialized programs. It offers comprehensive training in areas such as **Air Traffic Control**, **Cabin Attendant Services**, and **Aviation Business Management**. For those aiming for professional piloting or air traffic control careers, the requirements are exceptionally stringent, involving specialized medical clearances and dedicated instruction, often conducted in Japanese or a blend of Japanese and specialized industry English (Aviation English). This is a globally respected program and a major draw for the university.
*   **College of Performing and Visual Arts:** Located primarily at the Tsurukawa Campus, this college nurtures creative talent in Music, Theater, Cinema, and Art. Programs are highly practical, emphasizing performance and production. It maintains excellent facilities, including dedicated theaters and sound studios, preparing graduates for professional roles in the creative industries.
*   **College of Education and Social Innovation:** A newer Gakugun focusing on modern pedagogical methods, educational technology, and tackling complex social issues through innovative solutions. It caters to future educators, policy makers, and researchers.

## International Student Support

J.F. Oberlin University is known for providing a structured and welcoming environment for international students, recognizing that navigating a new academic system and culture requires significant assistance.

### Application Requirements

International applicants generally follow one of two primary pathways:

*   **Japanese Language Track (Most Colleges):** Requires applicants to submit official results from the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**, specifically demonstrating high scores in Japanese as a Foreign Language, along with relevant subject tests (e.g., Mathematics, Japan and the World). A minimum Japanese language level of JLPT N2 (and preferably N1 for competitive or technical colleges like Health and Welfare or Aviation) is often expected for academic success.
*   **English-Medium Track (Limited Programs, e.g., Global Studies):** Students apply using non-EJU qualifications (SAT, ACT, IB, A-Levels) and proof of English proficiency (TOEFL/IELTS). However, even in these tracks, mandatory Japanese language classes are built into the curriculum to ensure effective social integration and daily life management.

### Scholarships and Financial Aid

Oberlin offers substantial financial relief to international students, recognizing the cost of living and education in the Tokyo area. Key scholarship opportunities include:

*   **Oberlin University Tuition Reduction Scholarship:** Many international students are eligible for significant tuition fee reductions, sometimes covering 30% or more of the yearly tuition, based on academic merit and financial need. This is often applied automatically upon successful enrollment.
*   **Honors Scholarships:** Offered annually to students who maintain exceptional academic performance after matriculation.
*   **JASSO Scholarship:** International students are strongly encouraged and actively assisted in applying for external scholarships, most notably the highly beneficial JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) Scholarship for privately financed international students.

### Housing and Lifestyle

The university manages several dormitories and maintains partnerships with external housing providers, ensuring international students have immediate, secure housing options upon arrival. The primary options are:

*   **Oberlin Dormitories:** Located near the Machida and Tsurukawa campuses, offering single or shared rooms. These facilities are generally highly supportive, often incorporating resident assistants (RAs) to help new students acclimate.
*   **International Houses:** Dedicated housing that mixes Japanese and international students, fostering intensive cultural exchange and immediate integration.

Machida offers a lower cost of living compared to central Tokyo, yet remains directly connected to Shinjuku and other major hubs via the Odakyu and JR Yokohama lines. The campus itself is surrounded by convenient shopping, dining, and recreational facilities, providing a balanced student life.

## Tuition & Fees

J.F. Oberlin University's financial structure is typical of large private institutions in Japan, requiring a one-time admission fee followed by recurring annual tuition. The fees listed below represent general undergraduate programs (costs for specialized colleges like Aviation or Performing Arts may be higher due to facility usage fees and specialized training costs).

| Item                      | Amount (JPY) | Notes                                                                   |
| :------------------------ | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admission Fee**         | 250,000      | Paid only upon initial enrollment. Non-refundable.                        |
| **Yearly Tuition**        | 1,150,000    | Standard rate for Humanities/Business. Does not include fees.            |
| **Facilities/Lab Fees**   | ~150,000 - 200,000 | Varies significantly by college (e.g., higher for Arts or Aviation). |
| **Total First Year Cost (Estimate)** | ~1,550,000    | Before any scholarships or fee reductions are applied.             |

### Important Financial Considerations

*   **Hidden Costs:** Students must budget for required health insurance (mandatory in Japan), commuting expenses (though Machida is relatively convenient, monthly rail passes add up), and initial setup costs for housing (deposits, key money, etc., if moving off-campus).
*   **Scholarship Impact:** Given the high probability of receiving the Oberlin Tuition Reduction Scholarship, international students can realistically expect their effective yearly tuition burden to be significantly lower than the stated rate, often dropping below 1,000,000 JPY after aid, making the university highly competitive from a cost perspective among Tokyo private schools.
*   **Part-Time Work:** The Machida area offers ample opportunities for approved part-time work (up to 28 hours per week with a student visa), helping students manage living expenses and gain essential Japanese work experience.
