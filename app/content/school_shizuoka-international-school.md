## School Overview

Shizuoka International School offers a focused and supportive environment for international students aiming to pursue higher education in Japan. While specific details regarding its founding history and detailed philosophy are not available, the school's curriculum and features clearly emphasize preparing students for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) and ensuring a smooth transition into university life. The atmosphere likely prioritizes academic success, cultural immersion, and personalized support. The small capacity suggests a close-knit community where students receive individualized attention.

## Location & Surroundings

Located in the Sena district of Aoi Ward in Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, the school offers a setting away from the bustle of major metropolitan areas. Shizuoka is known for its beautiful natural surroundings, including views of Mount Fuji and its proximity to the Pacific coast. While the provided data doesn't specify nearby amenities, it's likely that convenience stores and other essential services are within easy reach. Detailed information on specific transportation options and travel times from major stations isn't provided, but further research would be beneficial for prospective students. For example, researching the nearest JR train stations (e.g., Shizuoka Station) and bus lines from the school would provide a much better picture of convenience and commute times.

    *   Walking: Time to be determined, depending on distance to bus stops/stations.

The curriculum focuses on comprehensive Japanese language training, EJU preparation, and guidance for university selection. While details on specific curriculum levels are not provided, it's reasonable to assume the courses cover a range of proficiency levels, progressively building students' skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Conversational Japanese is emphasized, reflecting the school's commitment to practical language skills. Furthermore, EJU preparation likely involves intensive practice in the subjects required for the exam, such as Japanese as a Foreign Language, Mathematics, Science, and Japan and the World. Without more information, the inclusion of culture and business electives cannot be confirmed, though these could be important supplements to overall learning.
