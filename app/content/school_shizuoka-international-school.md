## 🏫 School Overview

Shizuoka International School (静岡インターナショナルスクール) offers a focused and supportive environment for international students seeking to pursue higher education in Japan. While specific details regarding its founding history and detailed philosophy are not available in the provided data, the school's curriculum and features clearly indicate a strong emphasis on preparing students for the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) and ensuring a smooth transition into university life. The atmosphere likely prioritizes academic success, cultural immersion, and personalized support. The small capacity suggests a close-knit community where students receive individualized attention.

## 📍 Location & Surroundings

Located in the Sena district of Aoi Ward in Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, the school offers a setting away from the hustle and bustle of major metropolitan areas. Shizuoka is known for its beautiful natural surroundings, including views of Mount Fuji and its proximity to the Pacific coast. While the provided data doesn't specify nearby amenities, it's likely that convenience stores and other essential services are within easy reach. Detailed information on specific transportation options and travel times from major stations isn't provided, but further research would be beneficial for prospective students. For example, research around nearest JR train stations (e.g., Shizuoka Station) and bus lines from the school would provide much better picture of convenience and commute times.
