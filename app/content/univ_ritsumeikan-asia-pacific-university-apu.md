## University Overview & Reputation

Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU), established in 2000 by the Ritsumeikan Trust (which also governs the prestigious Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto), is a truly innovative institution within the Japanese higher education system. While APU isn't part of the traditional 'Soukeisen' (Waseda/Keio) or 'MARCH' university groups geographically, its academic standing is built on a deep commitment to internationalization, positioning it among Japan's top private, globally-focused universities. APU was founded on the principles of 'Freedom, Peace, Humanity, International Mutual Understanding, and the Future Shape of the Asia Pacific Region,' serving as a model for integrating global education into Japan.

APU distinguishes itself through its commitment to a 50/50 student body composition, with half of the students being international and a 50/50 ratio of Japanese and international faculty. This balance fosters a unique, multilingual learning environment where cross-cultural communication is not just encouraged but essential to the academic experience. Located in Beppu, Oita Prefecture, away from major metropolitan areas like Tokyo or Osaka, the university fosters an intimate and focused academic community, attracting students who are serious about cross-cultural engagement rather than simply seeking urban convenience. The Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) recognizes APU as a leader in global education, frequently citing it as having one of the highest percentages of international students and faculty among Japanese universities.

The university's academic reputation, particularly in management and regional studies, is strong. Its programs are well-regarded for blending Asian perspectives with global standards. For international students, APU provides a rare opportunity to pursue a full degree in Japan entirely in English while offering intensive Japanese language instruction. This ensures graduates are competitive in both global and local job markets. The social reputation is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting its diversity and often being called a 'microcosm of the world.' This unparalleled environment makes APU a key choice for students seeking a truly international university experience grounded in Japan.

## Faculties & Signature Programs

APU organizes its undergraduate education into four distinct colleges, all designed to support bilingual education and interdisciplinary approaches to global issues.

### Signature Programs

#### College of International Management (APM)

APM is APU’s most prestigious and recognized undergraduate program, earning international acclaim for its quality. It is one of the few business schools in Japan to hold the highly respected **AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) accreditation**. This accreditation is a global benchmark of quality, ensuring an APM degree is recognized worldwide. The curriculum is delivered equally in English and Japanese tracks, covering fundamental business disciplines while emphasizing the specific challenges and opportunities within the rapidly growing Asia Pacific economies. The program’s strength lies in its diverse faculty who bring real-world international experience, and its specialized tracks, such as Strategic Management and Innovation and Economics, which prepare students for leadership roles in multicultural settings. The opportunity to study business in an environment where 50% of the students come from abroad provides invaluable practical training in global collaboration.

#### College of Asia Pacific Studies (APS)

APS is the foundational college of APU, focusing on political science, international relations, and socio-cultural studies specific to the Asia Pacific region. APS stands out due to its commitment to interdisciplinary research into peace studies, economic development, and cultural conflict resolution. Unlike many general International Relations programs, APS requires students to adopt an 'Asia Pacific perspective,' critically analyzing global trends through the lens of regional history and contemporary issues. For international students interested in diplomacy, international NGOs, or working with global development organizations, APS offers a theoretically sound yet regionally focused curriculum. Its core strength lies in its capacity to draw connections between complex international systems and local societal structures, facilitated by field studies and immersion programs across various Asian countries, fostering practical understanding far beyond textbook theories.

## International Student Admissions & Life

### Admissions Process

APU's admissions process for international students is highly accessible and specifically designed to accommodate diverse educational backgrounds. Unlike many traditional Japanese universities, APU offers both an English-based track and a Japanese-based track, making the application very flexible.

*   **Direct Application (English Track):** Most international students apply through this route. EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students) is generally **not required** for students applying to the English-based degree programs.
*   **Required Documentation:** Applicants must submit standardized academic documents (high school transcripts, graduation certificate), and proof of English proficiency (TOEFL iBT 75+, IELTS 6.0+, PTE 50+, or equivalent). APU also accepts SAT or ACT scores, though these are optional but highly recommended to strengthen the application.
*   **Essay and Portfolio:** A compelling essay explaining the motivation for studying at APU and linking it to future career goals is mandatory. Students with unique achievements or leadership experience may also submit supplementary portfolios.
*   **Interview:** Successful candidates are often invited for a mandatory online or in-person interview. This interview is crucial, as the admissions committee assesses the applicant's communication skills, cross-cultural adaptability, and genuine interest in the APU spirit of diversity and global collaboration.

### English-Taught Programs

**Crucially, all four undergraduate colleges at APU—APS, APM, ST, and CS—offer complete degree programs that are taught 100% in English.** This means an international student can graduate with a Japanese university degree without needing Japanese fluency upon entry. While students are required to take Japanese language classes (JLP) as part of the curriculum, all core academic content, lectures, exams, and thesis requirements can be fulfilled entirely in English. This dual-language environment is a cornerstone of APU's identity.

### Student Support

APU provides robust support tailored to the unique needs of its highly international student body. The **Student Office** and the **Academic Advising Office** are skilled in navigating intercultural issues. Key services include:

*   **Visa and Immigration Support:** Comprehensive assistance with initial visa application, renewals, and necessary reporting to Japanese authorities.
*   **GAKU (Global Access and Knowledge Utilization) Support:** Dedicated tutors and academic advisors assist students who may struggle with the transition to university-level studies or those navigating language barriers.
*   **Counselling and Health Services:** Culturally sensitive mental health counselling, often available in multiple languages, recognizing the stresses associated with studying far from home.
*   **First-Year Residence:** APU guarantees accommodation in the AP House dormitory for all first-year students, which greatly simplifies the initial transition to life in Japan and fosters immediate cultural integration.

### Campus Life & Diversity

APU’s campus is perhaps the most diverse in all of Japan, boasting students from over 130 countries and regions. The international student body typically comprises around 50% of the total enrollment, creating an atmosphere that feels more like a global convention center than a typical Japanese university. Campus life is vibrant and highly focused on cultural exchange. There are hundreds of student clubs (called Circles), many of which are dedicated to specific cultural activities, from traditional Japanese arts (like Taiko and Tea Ceremony) to specific regional cultural events (like the Multicultural Weeks, where various national groups showcase their heritage). This high degree of diversity ensures that APU graduates possess exceptional cross-cultural communication skills, a major asset in the global job market.

## Tuition, Scholarships & Cost of Living

Studying at APU involves expenses typical of a high-quality private university in Japan, though the overall cost of living is significantly lower due to its location in Beppu.

### Detailed Cost Table

| Item                                 | Amount (JPY)          |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Admission Fee (Enrollment)           | 200,000 JPY           |
| Yearly Tuition (Undergraduate, Estimate) | 1,300,000 JPY         |
| Facility and Other Fees            | 100,000 JPY           |
| **Estimated First Year Total**       | **1,600,000 JPY**     |

*Note: Tuition figures are estimates based on standard APU fees and may vary slightly year to year. Science and engineering programs are generally not applicable as APU focuses on humanities, management, and social sciences.*

### Scholarship Opportunities

APU is highly proactive in securing financial stability for its international students, making it one of the most scholarship-accessible private universities in Japan.

*   **APU Tuition Reduction Scholarship:** This is the most common and vital scholarship. Based on admission application results, APU awards substantial tuition reductions ranging from 30% to 100% of tuition costs. This scholarship is highly competitive and is determined at the time of admission, allowing students to plan their finances precisely before arriving.
*   **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarships:** APU is often successful in recommending newly admitted international students for MEXT scholarships. These government scholarships cover not only tuition but also provide a monthly stipend and often round-trip airfare. Students must indicate their interest during the application process.
*   **External Scholarships:** Numerous private foundations and regional organizations offer financial aid specifically for APU students, leveraging the university's diverse population. These are managed by the Student Office after enrollment.

### Cost of Living

Beppu, Oita Prefecture, offers a significantly lower cost of living compared to metropolitan areas like Tokyo, Osaka, or even Fukuoka. Known as a famous hot spring (onsen) town, Beppu provides a pleasant, student-focused environment.

*   **Rent:** While APU guarantees first-year students residence in the AP House dormitories (approx. 40,000–50,000 JPY/month including utilities), off-campus housing is also inexpensive, averaging 30,000–50,000 JPY/month for a simple apartment.
*   **Food:** Due to proximity to the sea and local farming, food costs are manageable.
*   **Transportation:** The campus is served by local buses, but overall travel within Beppu is cheaper than in major cities.

A rough monthly budget estimate for living expenses in Beppu, excluding tuition but including rent, food, and miscellaneous costs, typically falls in the range of **80,000 JPY to 120,000 JPY**.

## Campus Location & Access

### Main Campus Vibe

APU is situated atop the scenic Jumonjibaru plateau, overlooking the city of Beppu and Beppu Bay. The location is purposefully separate from the city's bustle, fostering a dedicated, cohesive residential campus community. The campus itself is modern, featuring high-tech classrooms, extensive library resources, and the large AP House dormitories. The surrounding area is relatively quiet, characterized by rolling hills and traditional Japanese hot spring resorts, providing a relaxed, safe, and focused academic atmosphere. The city of Beppu itself is charming, manageable, and heavily geared toward supporting the student population, making daily life convenient despite the distance from a major urban center.
