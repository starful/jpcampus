## International Student Admissions & Life

The application process for international students at Kobe University typically involves several steps. Firstly, prospective students need to carefully review the admission requirements for their desired program, as these can vary depending on the faculty and degree level. Generally, applicants will need to submit academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose, and standardized test scores.

For undergraduate programs, many applicants will be required to take the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**. This exam assesses Japanese language proficiency, as well as academic skills in subjects like mathematics and science. In addition to the EJU, applicants will also need to demonstrate English language proficiency through either the **TOEFL iBT** or **IELTS Academic** exam. Minimum score requirements vary, but a competitive score is generally expected. Graduate programs often require similar documentation but may place greater emphasis on research experience and publications. Some programs may also conduct interviews, either in person or via video conferencing, to assess the applicant's suitability for the program.

Kobe University offers several degree programs taught entirely in English, catering to international students who may not yet have sufficient Japanese language proficiency. These programs are primarily offered at the graduate level and include the Global MBA, various programs in the Graduate School of International Cooperation Studies, and select programs in science and engineering. While specific program details should be verified on the university's website, the availability of these English-taught programs makes Kobe University a welcoming option for international students. In addition to these degree programs, many faculties offer individual courses in English, allowing international students to customize their academic experience.

Kobe University has a dedicated **International Student Center** that provides a wide range of support services for international students. This center offers assistance with:

*   Visa applications
*   Housing arrangements
*   Academic advising
*   Personal counseling

The center also organizes social events and activities to help international students integrate into the university community and experience Japanese culture. Academic advisors are available to help students with course selection, research opportunities, and career planning. Counseling services are also available to provide emotional support and address any challenges students may face while studying abroad. The university offers a comprehensive support system to ensure that international students have a positive and successful experience at Kobe University.

With approximately 1500 international students, Kobe University fosters a diverse and multicultural campus environment. There are numerous student clubs and organizations that cater to the interests of international students, including:

*   **Accommodation:** 30,000 - 60,000 JPY (depending on the type of housing and location)
