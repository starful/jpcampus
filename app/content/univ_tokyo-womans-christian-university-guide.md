## 🏫 University Overview

Tokyo Woman's Christian University (TWCU), known in Japanese as 'Tonojo,' stands as one of the most prestigious and historic private women's universities in Japan. Founded in 1918 by Dr. Nitobe Inazo—the renowned educator, diplomat, and former face of the 5,000 yen note—the university was established based on the spirit of Christian liberalism. The institution was built through the cooperation of six North American Protestant denominations, reflecting a global outlook since its inception. For over a century, TWCU has dedicated itself to the cultivation of 'service and sacrifice' and the pursuit of truth, as encapsulated in its motto: 'QUAECUNQUE SUNT VERA' (Whatever things are true).

Located in the quiet residential area of Zenpukuji in Suginami, Tokyo, the campus is a masterpiece of architectural history. Many of its buildings were designed by Antonin Raymond, a protégé of Frank Lloyd Wright, and are recognized as Registered Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan. The environment offers a serene, green oasis that is conducive to deep academic study, yet it is only a short walk or bus ride away from Kichijoji, consistently voted as one of the most desirable neighborhoods to live in Tokyo due to its vibrant culture, shops, and Inokashira Park.

For international students, TWCU offers a unique 'small-class' education model. Unlike the massive private universities in Tokyo where lectures can house hundreds of students, TWCU maintains an intimate setting where professors know their students by name. This environment is particularly beneficial for non-native speakers who require more direct interaction with faculty to master complex academic subjects in Japanese.

## 🎓 Faculties & Departments

In 2018, the university restructured its academic organization into a single, comprehensive faculty—the **Faculty of Arts and Science**. This move was designed to promote interdisciplinary learning, allowing students to bridge the gap between different fields of study while maintaining a specialized focus. The faculty is divided into five main departments, each offering multiple programs:

### 1. Department of Humanities
This department focuses on the core of liberal arts. It includes programs in **Philosophy**, **Japanese Literature**, and **History**. For international students, the Japanese Literature program provides a deep dive into both classical and modern texts, offering a rigorous linguistic and cultural foundation. The History program covers Japanese, Asian, and Western histories, encouraging a comparative perspective.

### 2. Department of International Culture and Communication
This is one of the most popular departments for students looking toward global careers. It includes **English Literature and Culture**, and **International Culture**. This department emphasizes cross-cultural understanding and communication skills. International students here often find themselves in a diverse environment where the exchange of global perspectives is a daily occurrence.

### 3. Department of Psychology and Communication
Combining the scientific study of the mind with the practical application of communication, this department includes **Psychology** and **Communication**. The psychology program is highly regarded for its research facilities and its focus on both social and clinical aspects, while the communication program analyzes how information flows within society.

### 4. Department of Social Sciences
This department offers programs in **Economics**, **Sociology**, and **Community Studies**. It is designed for students who want to understand the mechanisms of modern society. The curriculum emphasizes data analysis and field research, preparing students to tackle real-world social and economic issues in Japan and abroad.

### 5. Department of Mathematical Science
Distinct among women's liberal arts colleges, this department offers strong programs in **Mathematics** and **Information Science**. It challenges the gender stereotypes in STEM fields in Japan, providing a supportive environment for women to excel in coding, data science, and theoretical mathematics.

## 🌍 International Student Support

TWCU is deeply committed to supporting its international student population, acknowledging the unique challenges of studying abroad. While the university is relatively small, its support systems are robust and personalized.

### Language and Academic Support
The university offers specialized Japanese language courses tailored to the needs of international students. Beyond language, the **Learning Commons** provides a space where students can receive tutoring and assistance with academic writing, which is vital for succeeding in Japanese-taught seminars. There is also a 'Peer Tutor' system where Japanese students help international students with their studies and daily life.

### Housing and Dormitories
International students have access to the **Mure Dormitory** and other university-affiliated housing. Living in the dormitory is an excellent way to integrate into the student community and practice Japanese. The dormitories are safe, affordable, and located within a reasonable commuting distance from the campus.

### International Exchange Lounge
This serves as a hub for cultural exchange. The university regularly organizes 'International Day' events, cultural workshops (such as tea ceremony or calligraphy), and exchange parties. These activities ensure that international students do not feel isolated and can build lasting friendships with local Japanese students.

### Career Support for International Students
One of the greatest strengths of TWCU is its career center. The university has a stellar reputation among Japanese corporations for producing diligent, highly skilled graduates. The career center provides specialized guidance for international students, including workshops on 'shukatsu' (job hunting) in Japan, resume writing for Japanese companies, and mock interviews. Many international graduates find employment in major Japanese firms in the sectors of trade, finance, and education.

## 💰 Tuition & Fees

As a private university, TWCU’s tuition is higher than public institutions but remains competitive with other top-tier private liberal arts colleges in Tokyo. The following is an estimated breakdown of the costs for the first year:

*   **Admission Fee:** 200,000 JPY (Paid only in the first year).
*   **Tuition (Annual):** Approx. 780,000 JPY.
*   **Facility and Equipment Fees:** Approx. 320,000 JPY.
*   **Other Miscellaneous Fees:** Approx. 50,000 JPY.
*   **Total First Year Cost:** Approximately 1,350,000 JPY.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships
TWCU offers a **Tuition Reduction Program** for privately financed international students who demonstrate financial need and maintain high academic standing. This reduction can be as much as 30% of the tuition fee. Additionally, there are several internal scholarships specifically for international students, such as the 'Tokyo Woman’s Christian University International Student Scholarship.' Students are also eligible to apply for external scholarships, including those from **JASSO** (Japan Student Services Organization) and various private foundations. The university's financial aid office provides detailed counseling to help students secure the necessary funding for their education.

## 📝 Admission Process for International Students

To enter TWCU as a full-time degree-seeking student, international applicants usually apply through the 'Special Entrance Examination for International Students.' This process typically involves:

1.  **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU):** Applicants must submit their EJU scores. Specifically, the Japanese as a Foreign Language subject is mandatory, along with other subjects (Japan and the World, or Mathematics) depending on the chosen department.
2.  **JLPT (Optional but Recommended):** While EJU is the primary metric, having a JLPT N1 or N2 certificate can be advantageous.
3.  **University-Specific Examination:** This often includes an essay (小論文 - shōrunbun) written in Japanese and a rigorous interview with faculty members.
4.  **Application Period:** Generally, applications are accepted in late autumn (October/November) for April enrollment.

Prospective students are encouraged to visit the campus during 'Open Campus' days in the summer to experience the atmosphere and speak directly with professors and current international students. Tokyo Woman’s Christian University remains a premier choice for women who seek a rigorous, supportive, and culturally rich academic experience in the heart of Japan’s capital.
