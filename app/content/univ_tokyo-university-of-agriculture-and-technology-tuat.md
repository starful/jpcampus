### Faculty of Engineering (Koganei Campus)
The Faculty of Engineering maintains a reputation for high-level research in foundational and applied technologies, often leveraging bio-integration with traditional engineering disciplines. Key departments include:

1.  **Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering:** Concentrates on robotics, precision machinery, thermal engineering, and next-generation manufacturing processes (Monozukuri).
2.  **Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering:** Covers communication systems, advanced electronic devices, power electronics, and integrated circuits, crucial for modern infrastructure.
3.  **Department of Applied Physics and Chemical Engineering:** Focuses on new material science, nanotechnology, physical chemistry, and chemical process optimization, essential for sustainable manufacturing.
4.  **Department of Computer and Information Science:** Dedicated to artificial intelligence, data science, software engineering, and high-performance computing, driving the digital transformation of agriculture and industry.

### Graduate Schools
TUAT places immense emphasis on graduate study, where most international students engage in research. The Graduate Schools of Agriculture and Engineering offer Master's and Doctoral programs, allowing students to specialize deeply in sub-fields such as biological production science, environmental engineering, quantum systems, and veterinary public health. The **Graduate School of Technology Management (MOT)** is particularly popular, offering interdisciplinary programs focused on the management of technology and innovation, often catering to mid-career professionals and international students seeking a blend of engineering and business acumen.

## 🌍 International Student Support

TUAT is committed to integrating its international student body effectively into both academic and Japanese life. The university’s International Center serves as the primary hub for support services, covering immigration, academic counseling, and cultural adjustment.

### Housing and Accommodation

TUAT offers several avenues for housing, crucial for students newly arriving in the demanding Tokyo metropolitan area:

*   **International Houses:** The university manages dedicated dormitories, such as the TUAT International House, located near the Fuchu campus, offering subsidized, furnished apartments for both single students and families. Priority is generally given to newly arrived international students, especially government-sponsored (MEXT) scholars and official exchange students, ensuring a smoother transition.
*   **Guaranteed Housing:** While not a strict guarantee for all, TUAT strives to assist incoming MEXT scholars and specific program participants with initial accommodation placement, significantly reducing the stress of finding private housing immediately upon arrival.
*   **Private Housing Support:** The International Center provides guidance and listings for trustworthy private apartments near both the Fuchu and Koganei campuses, often linking students with local real estate agencies familiar with international tenants.

### Scholarships and Financial Aid

Financial support is robust, particularly reflecting the university's status as a National University:

1.  **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship:** TUAT is a prime destination for MEXT research students. These highly prestigious scholarships cover tuition, admission fees, and provide a monthly stipend, drastically reducing the financial burden.
2.  **TUAT Fee Waiver System:** A crucial support mechanism is the **Tuition Fee Exemption** program. Based on financial need and academic performance, international students (especially private expense students) can apply for a full or half waiver of both the admission fee and the annual tuition fee. Competition is high but the availability of this program is a significant advantage of attending a national university.
3.  **JASSO and Private Scholarships:** The university actively helps students apply for supplementary external scholarships, including those offered by the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO), local foundations, and private corporations. JASSO scholarships, such as the Honors Scholarship, provide essential monthly stipends to eligible private expense students.

### Language and Cultural Support

For students entering regular degree programs (taught in Japanese), TUAT offers comprehensive Japanese language courses designed to quickly elevate their proficiency to a level suitable for technical research and daily life. Additionally, extensive orientation programs and mentorship schemes connect new international students with senior students and faculty members, facilitating cultural acclimatization and academic success.

## 💰 Tuition & Fees

As a Japanese National University, TUAT adheres to the standard fee structure mandated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). These fees are significantly lower than those typically charged by private universities, making TUAT an exceptionally cost-effective option for high-quality specialized education.

### Standard Fees (AY 2024 Estimates)

| Item | Cost (JPY) | Notes |
