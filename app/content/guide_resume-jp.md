# Mastering the Japanese Resume: A Comprehensive Guide to the 'Rirekisho'

For many international students, the first major hurdle to finding a part-time job (arubaito) or launching a career in Japan isn’t just the language barrier—it is the paperwork. In Japan, the standard resume, known as a **Rirekisho (履歴書)**, is a highly formalized document that follows strict cultural conventions. Unlike the creative and flexible CVs common in the West, the Rirekisho is a standardized form designed to present your background in a clean, uniform, and easily comparable way.

If you are an international student preparing to enter the Japanese job market, understanding the nuances of the Rirekisho is essential. This guide will walk you through every section of the document, from your personal information to the art of self-promotion, ensuring you make a professional first impression on Japanese recruiters.

## 1. Understanding the Rirekisho Format vs. Western Resumes

Before you pick up a pen or open a digital template, you must understand what makes the Japanese Rirekisho unique. In many Western countries, a resume is a marketing tool where you emphasize achievements and customize the layout to stand out. In Japan, the Rirekisho is a formal record of your history. Its consistency allows employers to quickly scan for key information like your age, education, and tenure at previous jobs.

While some modern tech startups in Japan accept Western-style "CVs" (often called *Shokumu Keirekisho* for detailed work history), the standard *Rirekisho* remains the absolute requirement for almost every application.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | Western Resume/CV | Japanese Rirekisho |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Format** | Flexible, personalized layout. | Standardized, rigid grid-style form. |
| **Photo** | Rarely used (discouraged in some countries). | **Mandatory.** Must be a professional headshot. |
| **Personal Info** | Minimal (Name, Contact). | Detailed (Age, Gender, Full Address). |
| **Length** | Usually 1–2 pages. | Usually 2 pages (fixed template). |
| **Chronology** | Often reverse-chronological (newest first). | **Chronological** (oldest first). |
| **Tone** | Assertive and achievement-oriented. | Humble, factual, and polite. |

### Handwritten or Digital?
Historically, Rirekisho were always handwritten to show the applicant's character through their penmanship. Today, digital versions (PDF or Excel) are widely accepted, especially in the tech and international sectors. However, if you are applying to a very traditional Japanese company or a local small business, a neatly handwritten Rirekisho using a black ballpoint pen still carries significant "sincerity" points.

## 2. Personal Information and the Critical Role of the Photo

The top section of the Rirekisho covers your basic identity. While it seems straightforward, there are several "Japan-specific" rules to follow.

### Name and Furigana
In the name section, you must write your name as it appears on your residence card. Above your name, you will see a small space for **Furigana (ふりがな)**. If the form asks for "ふりがな" (Hiragana), write your name’s pronunciation in Hiragana. If it asks for "フリガナ" (Katakana), use Katakana. This is vital so the recruiter knows exactly how to pronounce your name.

### Dates and Eras
Japan uses two calendar systems: the Western Year (Seireki) and the Japanese Imperial Era (Wareki). While both are acceptable, you must be consistent throughout the document. If you start with Western years (e.g., 2024), do not switch to Reiwa 6 later.

| Western Year | Japanese Era (Wareki) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1989 – 2019 | Heisei (平成) |
| 2019 – Present | Reiwa (令和) |

### The Photo (Shashin)
The photo is arguably the most scrutinized part of the Rirekisho. It is not a casual selfie; it is a professional portrait.
- **Size:** Exactly 30mm wide x 40mm high.
- **Recency:** Must be taken within the last 3 months.
- **Attire:** You should be wearing a dark "recruit suit" (black or navy) with a white shirt.
- **Expression:** A neutral or very slight smile. Hair should be neat and away from the face.
- **Background:** Solid blue, white, or light gray.

**Pro-Tip:** Use a professional photo booth (Ki-Re-i) found near Japanese train stations. These booths have a specific "Rirekisho mode" that formats the photo perfectly. If you are mailing a physical copy, write your name on the back of the photo before gluing it down, just in case it peels off.

## 3. Education and Work History: The 'Gakureki' and 'Shokureki'

The middle section of the Rirekisho is divided into Education (**学歴 - Gakureki**) and Work Experience (**職歴 - Shokureki**). Unlike Western resumes, these must be listed in **chronological order**, starting from your past and moving toward the present.

### Education (Gakureki)
1.  **Start Point:** Usually, international students start from high school graduation.
2.  **Accuracy:** Write the official name of the school and the department/major. Do not abbreviate.
3.  **Entry/Exit:** For every school, you must have two lines: one for entering (入学 - nyugaku) and one for graduating (卒業 - sotsugyo).
    - *Example:* 
        - 2018/09: [University Name], Faculty of Economics, Entered.
        - 2022/06: [University Name], Faculty of Economics, Graduated.

### Work History (Shokureki)
After the education section, write "職歴" (Work History) in the center of the next line.
1.  **Full-time and Part-time:** List your full-time jobs. If you are a student applying for a part-time job, you can include previous part-time work (arubaito).
2.  **Standard Phrases:** For joining a company, use "入社" (nyusha). For leaving, use "一身上の都合により退社" (isshinjo no tsugo ni yori taisha), which is a polite, standard way to say you left for personal reasons.
3.  **The "End":** After your last entry, write "現在に至る" (genzai ni itaru - "to the present") if you are still working, or simply skip to the next step. On the very last line of the work history section, write "**以上**" (ijo - "The End") aligned to the right.

## 4. Qualifications (Shikaku) and Self-Promotion (Jiko PR)

This is where you can differentiate yourself from other candidates. In Japan, certifications are highly valued as proof of your effort and skill level.

### Qualifications (免許・資格 - Menkyo/Shikaku)
For international students, the **JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test)** is the most important qualification to list.
- Format: "Japanese Language Proficiency Test N1 (Passed)" or "日本語能力試験 N2 合格".
- Include the date you obtained the certificate.
- List other relevant certificates like TOEIC/TOEFL scores, BJT (Business Japanese Test), or driver’s licenses. If you have no qualifications yet, write "特になし" (tokuni nashi - "nothing in particular"), but try to avoid leaving this blank if possible.

### Self-Promotion (自己PR - Jiko PR)
The *Jiko PR* section is your chance to explain your strengths. Since Japanese culture values harmony and persistence, try to focus on these qualities:
- **Kyochosei (Cooperation):** Your ability to work well in a team and adapt to Japanese work culture.
- **Gakushu Iyoku (Willingness to learn):** Your proactive attitude toward mastering new tasks and improving your Japanese.
- **Keiken (Experience):** How your unique background as an international student (multilingualism, global perspective) can benefit the company.

### Motivation (志望動機 - Shibo Doki)
This is the "Why do you want to work here?" section. Be specific. Avoid generic phrases like "I want to improve my Japanese." Instead, say "I admire your company's commitment to [Specific Project/Service], and I want to contribute using my skills in [Your Skill]."

## 5. Final Checks and Common Pitfalls to Avoid

The Rirekisho is often seen as a test of your "attention to detail" (shinsetsu-sa). A single typo or a messy smudge can lead a recruiter to think you are careless.

### Checkpoint List:
*   **Erasers are Forbidden:** If you are handwriting and make a mistake, **do not** use white-out or cross it out. You must start over on a fresh sheet. This is why many people prefer digital versions!
*   **Empty Spaces:** Try not to leave large white spaces. If a section is empty, use "特になし."
*   **Consistency:** Check that your dates match. If you used the Western calendar in the Education section, ensure the Work History section follows suit.
*   **The "Ijo" (End):** Did you remember to write "以上" at the bottom of your work history? This is a small but vital formal requirement.
*   **Polite Language:** Ensure you use *Desu/Masu* (polite form) in the Jiko PR and Shibo Doki sections.

### Submitting the Document
- **By Email:** Send it as a PDF. Name the file clearly: `20241020_Rirekisho_YourName.pdf`.
- **By Post:** Do not fold the Rirekisho if possible. Use a clear plastic folder (clear file) and place it inside a large white envelope (Kakugata 2 size). Write "履歴書在中" (Rirekisho enclosed) in red ink on the front of the envelope.
- **In Person:** If handing it over during an interview, take it out of the folder and present it with both hands, facing the interviewer so they can read it immediately.

## Conclusion

Writing a Japanese Rirekisho can feel intimidating at first, but it is essentially a series of well-defined rules. By following the standard format, choosing a professional photo, and articulating your strengths through the *Jiko PR* section, you demonstrate not only your qualifications but also your respect for Japanese professional etiquette. 

Take your time, check your Kanji, and remember that this document is your first step toward a successful journey in Japan. Good luck with your applications—your hard work will surely pay off!
