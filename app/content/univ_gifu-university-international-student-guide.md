## 🏫 University Overview: The Heart of Central Japan

Gifu University, often referred to as "Gidai," is a prestigious national university located in Gifu City, the capital of Gifu Prefecture. Established in 1949, it has evolved into a leading research institution that emphasizes "Learning, Exploring, and Contributing." In 2020, Gifu University made history by forming the **Tokai National Higher Education and Research System (THERS)** through a strategic merger with Nagoya University. This unique administrative structure allows Gifu University students and researchers to access resources, joint programs, and collaborative research initiatives typically reserved for the highest-tier Imperial Universities in Japan.

Strategically positioned in the Chubu region, Gifu University serves as a bridge between the historical culture of rural Japan and the cutting-edge industrial prowess of the Tokai economic zone. Its single-campus layout at Yanagido is a significant advantage, fostering a close-knit academic community where students from diverse disciplines—from medicine to engineering—interact daily.

## 🎓 Academic Excellence and Faculty Breakdown

Gifu University is comprised of five main faculties, each offering specialized tracks for international students:

### 1. Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences
This is arguably the crown jewel of Gifu University. It is internationally recognized for its research in agriculture, food science, and veterinary medicine. The faculty operates one of the most advanced veterinary teaching hospitals in Japan. For international students interested in food security, environmental conservation, or bio-resource development, this faculty offers unparalleled laboratory facilities and field research sites.

### 2. Faculty of Engineering
Located in the industrial heartland of Japan, this faculty focuses on manufacturing (Monozukuri). It has strong ties with the automotive industry (including Toyota and its affiliates) and the aerospace sector. Specializations include Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Chemistry and Biomolecular Engineering. The research here is highly practical, focusing on sustainable energy, robotics, and smart materials.

### 3. School of Medicine
Including the Department of Medicine and the Department of Nursing, this school is affiliated with the Gifu University Hospital, a leading tertiary care center. The school is known for its research in regenerative medicine and genomic medicine. While entry is highly competitive for international students, the graduate programs (Masters and PhD) are particularly welcoming to global researchers.

### 4. Faculty of Regional Studies
This multidisciplinary faculty is unique to Gifu University. It combines social sciences, humanities, and environmental studies to solve modern regional challenges. International students here often study Japan’s regional revitalization, policy-making, and the balance between traditional culture and globalization.

### 5. Faculty of Education
Focusing on the development of future educators, this faculty offers specialized training in various school subjects and psychological support. It is deeply integrated with the local Gifu community, providing students with practical teaching experience in Japanese primary and secondary schools.

## 🧪 Research Innovation: The THERS Advantage

The integration with Nagoya University under THERS has transformed Gifu University’s research landscape. Students can benefit from the **Aerospace Research and Education Hub** and the **Glycoscience Institute (iGCORE)**, which is one of the world's most advanced centers for sugar chain research. This collaboration means that a student at Gifu University can participate in high-level research projects that involve the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and major global pharmaceutical companies.

For international students, this means your degree carries the weight of a top-tier national university system, backed by the combined intellectual property and funding of two major institutions. Gifu specifically leads in "Smart Agriculture" and "Next-Generation Energy Management," making it an ideal destination for those looking to work on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## 🌏 International Student Life and Support

Gifu University is remarkably supportive of its international community, which fluctuates between 500 and 600 students from over 30 countries. 

### Language and Cultural Integration
The **Organization for Promotion of Glocalization (GU-GLOCAL)** is the primary support body. It offers intensive Japanese language courses ranging from beginner to advanced business levels. Unlike many universities where international students are isolated, Gifu's "Tutor System" pairs incoming students with a Japanese peer who helps with everything from opening a bank account to navigating the library system.

### Housing and Cost of Living
One of the biggest draws for Gifu University is the affordability. Gifu City offers a high quality of life with significantly lower costs than Tokyo or Osaka. The university provides the **International House**, an on-campus dormitory specifically for international students and researchers. Rent is highly subsidized, often costing less than 20,000 JPY per month, including utilities. Private apartments near the campus are also affordable, typically ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 JPY.

### Campus Amenities
The Yanagido campus is a self-contained ecosystem. It features multiple cafeterias (with Halal options), a massive library, a post office, and a convenience store. The campus is surrounded by nature, with the Nagara River nearby, offering a serene environment for focused study.

## 💼 Career Prospects and Industrial Ties

Graduating from Gifu University provides a direct pipeline into the Japanese labor market. The university boasts one of the highest employment rates among national universities. Its Career Support Center organizes specialized job fairs where major companies from the Tokai region (Nagoya/Gifu/Aichi) actively recruit Gidai students.

For international students wanting to work in Japan, the university provides workshops on Japanese business etiquette, resume writing (Rirekisho), and interview preparation. The engineering and applied biology graduates are particularly sought after by Japanese manufacturing, chemical, and food processing giants. Many international alumni have secured positions at companies like Toyota, Mitsubishi Electric, and various research institutes.

## 📍 Living in Gifu: The Best of Both Worlds

Gifu City is a "Middle City" that offers the perfect balance of urban convenience and natural beauty. Known for the historic Gifu Castle atop Mount Kinka and the ancient tradition of Cormorant Fishing (Ukai) on the Nagara River, the city is rich in culture. 

- **Accessibility:** By rapid train, Gifu is only 20 minutes from Nagoya, Japan’s fourth-largest city. This means you can enjoy the quiet, affordable life of Gifu while having easy access to the shopping, entertainment, and international airport (Centrair) in Nagoya.
- **Climate:** Gifu experiences four distinct seasons. While summers can be hot, the autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms on campus are breathtaking. It is also close to some of Japan's best ski resorts in the Hida mountains.

## 📝 Admission Guide for International Students

### Undergraduate Admission
Prospective students typically need to take the **Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU)**. Required subjects usually include Japanese as a Foreign Language, Science (Physics/Chemistry/Biology), and Mathematics, depending on the faculty. A high level of Japanese proficiency (N2 or N1) is generally required for undergraduate courses as most lectures are conducted in Japanese.

### Graduate Admission
For Master’s and Doctoral programs, the requirements are more flexible. Many laboratories in Engineering and Applied Biological Sciences conduct research in English. Applicants should contact a potential supervisor (Professor) beforehand to discuss their research plan. Some programs offer English-medium tracks through the THERS joint degree programs.

### Scholarships
Most international students at Gifu University receive some form of financial aid. Options include:
- **MEXT Scholarship:** Full coverage by the Japanese government.
- **JASSO Scholarships:** Monthly stipends for high-achieving self-financed students.
- **Local Foundation Scholarships:** Gifu-based companies and organizations offer exclusive grants to Gidai students.
- **Tuition Waivers:** As a national university, Gifu offers 50% or 100% tuition exemptions for students facing financial hardship who have excellent academic records.
