Ryukoku University's **Faculty of International Studies** stands out as a particularly attractive option for international students. The Department of Global Studies, within this faculty, offers a comprehensive curriculum designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly interconnected world. What makes this program particularly appealing is that it is taught entirely in English. This allows students from diverse linguistic backgrounds to access a high-quality education without the immediate pressure of mastering Japanese. The curriculum covers a broad range of topics, including international relations, intercultural communication, global business, and development studies. Students are encouraged to develop critical thinking skills and engage in independent research, preparing them for careers in international organizations, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and multinational corporations. Furthermore, the faculty's emphasis on experiential learning provides students with opportunities to participate in internships, study abroad programs, and community engagement projects, further enhancing their global perspective and professional skills.

Another program of significant interest, particularly given Ryukoku University's historical roots, is the **Department of Buddhist Studies** within the Faculty of Letters. While primarily taught in Japanese, this department attracts international students interested in delving deeply into the philosophical and historical aspects of Buddhism, particularly Jodo Shinshu Buddhism. The department offers a rigorous academic curriculum that explores Buddhist doctrines, practices, and cultural impact. Students have the opportunity to study ancient texts, engage in philosophical debates, and learn from renowned scholars in the field. Although proficiency in Japanese is generally required for full participation in the program, the department often welcomes visiting scholars and researchers from overseas who are conducting research on Buddhist studies. The unique opportunity to study Buddhism within an institution deeply rooted in its traditions, coupled with access to extensive resources and a network of experts, makes this program a compelling choice for serious scholars of Buddhist thought.

## International Student Admissions & Life

The application process for international students at Ryukoku University generally involves several key steps. Firstly, prospective students typically need to demonstrate Japanese language proficiency, often through the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU). However, this requirement may be waived for programs offered entirely in English, such as those within the Faculty of International Studies. In such cases, proof of English proficiency is required, typically through TOEFL or IELTS scores. Specific score requirements vary by department, so it's essential to check the individual program guidelines. The application package usually includes academic transcripts, a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and a copy of your passport. Some departments may also require an interview, either in person or via video conference, to assess the applicant's suitability for the program. It's strongly recommended that international students begin the application process well in advance of the application deadline to allow ample time for document preparation and visa processing.

Ryukoku University boasts a number of degree programs offered entirely in English. These are primarily concentrated within the Faculty of International Studies, specifically the Department of Global Studies. These programs provide a valuable opportunity for students who may not yet be proficient in Japanese to pursue a degree at a prestigious Japanese university. The specific courses offered vary, but generally cover a broad range of topics related to international relations, intercultural communication, global business, and development studies. More information on the English-taught programs can be found on the university's international student website.

The university provides comprehensive support services for international students through its dedicated International Student Office. This office offers a range of services, including pre-arrival information, visa application assistance, orientation programs, academic advising, and counseling services. Academic advisors are available to assist students with course selection, academic planning, and navigating the Japanese academic system. Counseling services are available to provide emotional support and guidance on a variety of issues, such as cultural adjustment, stress management, and personal concerns. The International Student Office also provides assistance with visa renewals and other immigration-related matters. The goal is to create a welcoming and supportive environment where international students can thrive academically and personally.

Ryukoku University is home to a diverse community of international students, with approximately 384 students from various countries contributing to the vibrant campus atmosphere. Numerous student clubs and organizations cater to a wide range of interests, providing opportunities for international students to connect with local students and engage in extracurricular activities. These clubs range from sports clubs and cultural clubs to academic societies and volunteer organizations. The university actively promotes intercultural exchange and encourages students to participate in events and activities that celebrate diversity. The overall campus atmosphere is welcoming and inclusive, fostering a sense of belonging for international students. The buddy system, which pairs international students with local students, is particularly helpful in facilitating cultural exchange and providing support during the initial adjustment period.

*   **Food:** 20,000 - 30,000 JPY (cooking your own meals can significantly reduce this cost)
*   **Transportation:** 5,000 - 10,000 JPY (consider purchasing a student commuter pass for train or bus)
*   **Utilities (electricity, water, gas):** 5,000 - 10,000 JPY
